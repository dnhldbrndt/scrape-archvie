>tfw ugly bot not ugly enough so people feel sorry for you
>WHY CAN'T I JUST BE A FREAK

There's a reason why charity is considered a virtue and pity a vice, and it's the same reason the former is accepted with gratitude and the latter resentfully rejected. Proper charity is one man giving to a fellow human being due to a sense of brotherhood and its an act that accomplishes some actual good. Feed another person and he ceases to be tormented by hunger pangs, offer feasible advice and you've helped him extricate from his problems. 

The difference is that pity doesn't do a whit of good for its recipients precisely because it's an empty gift offered purely for the sake of the one giving it. Men speaking kind words when it comes to the plight of monsters with whom they share no sense of kinship are doing nothing more than chanting mantras against the forces of Fate and circumstance that can damn or save, bless or curse, through the compulsion of their gentlest whim. The handsome man forces a single tear from otherwise dry eyes for the sake of the repulsive monster because it's the closest thing to humility he's capable of. We suspect, whether rightly or wrongly, that powers that govern the cosmos despise hubris; and even gods know better than to tempt the Fates. 

The superficial kindness of the lovely toward the repulsive that they hate no less than the rest of humanity is the remnant of a very old superstition, no different than the villages who would provide petty sacrifices to the goblins and other evil sprites that lurked in the periphery, the shadowy places just beyond the reach of the village's light. If you don't want to suffer disease, you give the devil of pestilence his due regardless of how fiercely you despise him. 

The pity the lovely have for the repulsive is a ward, a charm. Soothe the monster, placate it, and it'll remain in the dark, distant places where it belongs.

>I just came to the realization that I am God. This planet, the universe and all of you are only my imagination.

The last time I heard someone assert something like this was when I was a student.

The person who uttered it was a student of the fine arts. College is often depicted as a strange liminal space between adolescence and adulthood where the typical rules of right and wrong are suspended. People can at long last drink what they wish, fuck who ever they will, indulge in every vice without the fear of judgement: small sins indulged in by imps dipping their toes in the River Styx. 

But my friend had already been fucked by countless men before stepping into the halls of Academia. Sexual promiscuity passe for her, she found a far more exciting dream.

Her professors taught that God died long ago and that artists would be tasked with filling the void. The world had grown ugly and sick; it was the glorious purpose of the artists to redeem it by rendering it lovely and healthy again. 

So my friend began to consider her paintings. the majority of which depicted herself, the Newest Testament. Her nightmares became ordeals with devils and her dreams trysts with angels.

During one of our last conversations she declared that I, as well as every other person she knew, was nothing more than a figment of her imagination. I'll admit, I found the idea seductive. The Great Goddess herself sat before me, within my reach. She was a bit overweight, her eyesight somewhat dim. The Architect of the Universe who decided, in Her infinite wisdom, that I should go to the grave unloved and unwanted, could have had the song of creation issuing from her throat choked into silence had I been so inclined.

Men make very poor gods and women even worse goddesses. It's the blessing of every counterfeit deity that each authentic devil recognizes this pitiful truth and relinquishes his hammer, too sad and tired to smash an idol even emptier than himself.

>even if youre deformed to the point where you cant get a gf, and if that matters so much to you, work so hard that youll be able to afford surgery and be in a position of power so that you dont even need one. and if you dont even do that, focus on other things. women are a meme. never has a chick made my life any better

Repulsive wizard though I am, one of those things who would live, grow old and die in the nursery regardless of whether he dreamed his nightmares in a rotting crib surrounded by unwanted moldy toys or in a sprawling palace adorned by coveted golden ones, even I recognize a sexual relationship is no panacea. 

A man with a diseased mind, cursed with a soul rendered morbid by infirmity, could be granted entrance into Heaven and suffer just as acutely as a healthy man condemned to Hell. Mother Nature can be exceptionally cruel to Her children, and sometimes She'll visit deformity upon the Spirit rather than the Flesh.

Angels can grow ill; incapable of experiencing the beauty that should have been their birthright as beautiful things, they stray from the delights of the Garden and become ensnared by its thorns. They smell flowers and the stench of sulfur fills their nostrils; permitted to consume the sweetest fruit, they taste nothing but ash.

That particular tragedy doesn't negate that of the the monster with a healthy spirit who would be capable of enjoying the Garden but isn't permitted entrance into it. He could enjoy a flower's scent but his nostrils are only allowed the smell of rot. The apple's sweetness is something his palate is capable of appreciating, but the fruit would rot before it would condescend to be touched by the monster's repulsive tongue.

Handsome Devil with his leprous soul and Repulsive Demon with its twisted body envy, resent and hate each other with the same frothing pathos.

Absurd, isn't it, considering that God and Nature have sentenced them to burn beside each other in Hell?

>Hope you get better though, maybe you will find a lot of happiness in solitude like the Great Desert Fathers have.

Have? Or perhaps more appropriately "had". The Desert Fathers are, and are now, and will always be gone. They were a failed experiment at one time and, that trial having run its monstrously unsuccessful course, neither exist now nor will they ever exist again.

It would be a grand testament to the power of the human spirit if it could actually exist in isolation. It would be marvelous if the spirit of a man, exorcised from his flesh, could during its long exile in the wilderness become something akin to a god. Hungry, he could devour his own flesh and somehow be satisfied, learning how to become a sacrifice upon his own altar. Desperate for a cooling rain, he could weep and wash the heat of the wicked world away. Seized by the Spirit, Jesus was driven into the desert so that he could, by enduring its agonies, learn how to become a god.

That's the myth, the fantasy, the illusory solace Nature offers to those who are relegated to the wasteland. Sadly, fairy-tales have the tendency of falling short. Christ, driven down into harsh wastelands by his divine madness, was tempted Lord Lucifer and, enduring his harsh initiation, earned the right to be considered the Son of God. And when his time of trial was complete, angels came to minster to him.

Saint Anthony wasn't provided that kind of solace. Suffering in his isolation, he prayed to God and God sent demons to torment him. He endured the tortures allotted to him and his reward was the opportunity to utter prayers so incoherent that the petitioner had no idea whether he was addressing the Queen of Heaven or the King of Hell. After a point, wild with desperation, it no longer mattered to our exile which one of the two answers.

Eventually, the Desert Philosopher expects only silence because, regardless of how loudly he cries out, neither God nor Goddess will respond with anything else.

>So anon, your still a virgin? At 30?
>>43307699
>As a Wizard, I have an advice for my brethren: if anyone ask you this question, lie

The last thing I want is to sow discord by disagreeing with one of my brothers. Having said that, I'm afraid I'll do so just the same.

If one reaches the age of thirty and has never had a single woman desire him, his fate has been sealed. The contract's been signed, with God enthusiastically providing the pen and Nature the ink. 

If someone who belongs to the tribe of men asks a thing sworn to the race of monsters whether they're a virgin, they already know the answer. It's a question posed for the same reason humans visit a carnival and pound the panes of glass separating them from the abominations on the other side. They want to see another tear, to hear another moan. The agony of those in Hell is precious if for no other reason than it can transform the misery of men into the joy of angels. 

Thing of it is, they come expecting this elixir in an adulterated form. By eliciting an old virgin's obvious lies, they've extracted diluted tears they can swallow without singing their throats in much the same way the Protestants can only participate in the Eucharist after they've convinced themselves they're drinking grape juice and not the blood of a tortured god.

Wizards, if an actual person is bold enough to ask whether you're a virgin, tell them. You're a sacrificial animal regardless, so why lay down as a smiling lamb instead of a screaming goat? Make them earn the joy they take in your misery. Tilt their world just a bit, remind them there are those who go down to the grave completely unwanted and unloved, that your biography is more than a sad fairy-tale or the fodder for cheap comedies. 

Though small, the race of monster will always be and men will always drink themselves silly with our blood. 

At the very least, we can take pains to ensure it burns just a little bit as it trickles down their throats.
>>43292516
>Why do ugly incels claim 80% of women pursue only the top 20% of men? It's like their incel religion, even though most people know it's not true at all.

Well, perhaps closer to a myth than a religion.

The thing about most myths is that though composed of smoke and illusion, nearly all have some tiny spark of truth glowing at their heart.

It's without a doubt that there will always be some men no woman will ever want. Regardless of how magnetic their personalities, how self-assured, how dedicated to improving themselves they may be, their ugliness will preclude any woman from ever desiring them. 

These true casualties of Nature's war are far and few between. Yet there are a far greater number of reasonably attractive men who find themselves without a mate. Many are socially awkward, shy, desperate to reach out but lacking the courage to. Too fragile to risk a first rejection or too demoralized to endure a second, they invoke their sacred story. The struggles of the Garden too daunting, they assure themselves they are just as repulsive as the true abominations are and retreat to safety of dim Purgatory.

It goes without saying the legion of lost souls haunting Limbo are not the same as the tiny number of proper monsters born to Hell. Deluded by their myth, the former eventually forget that simple fact and commit the same error a gentile does whenever he mistakes a dybbuk for a devil.
>>43274826
>eventually you internalize it/embrace it to the point of which you both dont care and would still feel like a virgin even if you fucked.

As a repulsive old wizard, that point is academic for something like myself, a mere thought experiment. Which isn't to say it's not a compelling one.

The wizard comes of age in Hell, with the demons serving as his familiars both his most hated tormentors and most intimate companions. Frothing Wrath, the shameful Lust of something that feels desire that will never be reciprocated, the grinding Envy that grips one's heart with its slimy claw every time one witnesses the happiness of others you'll never participate in: these become as natural as the flow of one's breath or the rush of one's blood. They alone know your secrets, are the only witnesses to your tears on those rare occasions when you weep alone in the dead of night.

Admittedly, it would be horrifying to face the prospect of having those demons driven out; unclean though they are, this legion of wicked spirits is the closest thing to a soul the unlovable monster ever had. Tantalizing though it's light may be, crawling into Paradise would be terrifying for a thing that spent a lifetime learning how to see in Pandemonium's darkness.

It would be a frightening and dangerous journey, just as all true adventures are. Granted, it's one that will never be anything more than fantasy for the unlovable, something for them to dream about while they sleep alone. And if their visions progress into nightmares, well, they'll inevitably awake with tears drying their faces.

Denied initiation into the race of men, one of the few mysteries permitted to the abominations given to such dreams is whether the tears staining their cheeks after waking are those of joy or despair.

>No matter what achievements I earn, I am still an unhappy miserable person.

While attending college, one of my Religious Studies professors screened Peter Brooks' "Mahabharata" in his Indian Philosophy seminar. It's been more than a decade and a half since then and I remember very little of it. However, one moment in the picture remains perfectly distinct in my mind. The villain of the epic, Duryodhana, had every thing any mortal man could ever desire. He had a harem of the loveliest women willing to satisfy his every sexual whim. Each dinner he attended was a feast, every battle resulted in victory. 

For all of his apparent blessings, Duryodhana was miserable. Seeing him drowning in melancholy, on the verge of succumbing to despair, his advisers reminded him of all of the good things he should be enjoying but, for whatever reason, was incapable of finding happiness in. All of their attempts to cheer him failing, they begged their lord to tell them why he was so discontent hoping, perhaps, they could bring him joy.

Wild, in a fit of frothing rage, the king cried out: "Why am I discontented? Because I want to be discontented!"

According to the Mahabharata, Duryodhana was a son of Kali, that wicked goddess who ruled the relentless flow of time. In that respect, we're all of us brothers to the miserable king. Our mortality demands we never find permanent joy lest we grow stagnant, lest we surrender to Death while we still draw breath. 

Haunting the forums dedicated to the incels, you'll find young men lamenting their virginity. When they eventually have sex as the vast majority of men do, they mourn the fact they never had a romantic relationship during adolescence.

The moment Faust became satisfied with Life was same he lost his humanity and surrendered his soul to Hell.
>>43187857
>to the ugly/undesirable robots 
>do you think plastic surgery can fix your ugliness/unattractiveness?

I've never been comfortable with the notion of plastic surgery. Granted, it should be something any ugly man would consider a boon. If God and Nature have been stingy with their blessings, why not appeal to the alchemy of men as a recourse? When he sold his soul to Mephistopheles for the chance to experience what he never had during his long, lonely life, the good Doctor Faust was taken by his new familiar to a witch whose potions had the power to make the sorcerer young and beautiful. What does it matter if one's loveliness is artificial if it permits him to experience joys that would otherwise be impossible? 

On the face of it, there's an appeal to the fantasy of tricking your way into a Paradise that you were never intended for. Why languish in Hell when you can slip into Heaven unnoticed? 

The problem is that, when all is said and done, all of that beauty is just glamour: a hollow illusion wrought with scalpels and stitches. The monster's ugliness stains his blood; essential to his very being, it's the closest thing an abomination has to a soul. That a ghoul resents being born in Hell doesn't change the fact that it's Hell he swore an oath to the moment he drew his very first breath. Though a love-spell can permeate no deeper than the skin, true ugliness reaches to the very heart of one's being.

As a monster, I dream of what it would be like to live as men do: to be loved, to be desired, to be considered with admiration. But I'd rather mourn for the impossibility of love as a proper citizen of Pandemonium than pretend I've achieved it as a hunted fugitive in Paradise. 

The monster who refuses to wrench the horns from his skull in a futile attempt to resemble a man retains a tiny bit of dignity in the process. Attempt to do otherwise, and he sacrifices what little virtue he actually possesses for the hope of something he never will.
>>43102905
>Or does some hope still linger inside?

We all know the story of Pandora's Jar. Overwhelmed by curiosity, the most dangerous vice, the first woman broke her jar's seal to peak beneath its lid. The act, though performed without malice, unloosed evil upon the world. Sickness, strife, violence and death leaped forth and began their endless campaign to extinguish mankind. Hope, however, remained within the jar.

More optimistic reiterations of the myth consider the remaining Hope to be the element that allowed mankind to sustain itself in the face of the horrors Pandora unleashed. Though no antidote, the remaining tonic served the purpose of every anesthetic: to endure the pain that is every man's lot long enough for him to justify drawing his next breath. 

The problem with such interpretations is that, unlike the devils that escaped from the jar, Hope remained in beautiful Pandora's possession and under Her control. Though misery was inevitable for every man, respite from it certainly wasn't. The Eternal Feminine had the authority to provide a glimpse of its light or deny it as She saw fit, guarding it as fiercely as anyone would the closest thing to kindness the heartless gods had allotted to the race of men.

One only experiences Hope if lovely Pandora grants him license to. If one can imagine being loved, he is lovable. Dreams are the blessings bestowed upon men who have drawn close enough to Pandora to be bathed in the light of the Hope she guards so steadfastly. Those unworthy to step into Her presence, the things abandoned to Despair by God and Nature, have only nightmares awaiting them when they close their eyes and descend into sleep: that daily rehearsal for death that prepares men for Paradise and monsters for Hell.

Never disregard the blessing of Hope simply due to its fragility. Though there is the ever-present threat of it shattering in your trembling hands, there are those who will never look upon it, let alone touch it.

It's absurd that a god like Dionysus was considered the divine embodiment of frenzy or Moloch that of wild, ravenous hunger when Chronos exceeded them both. 

Spending our entire lives immersed in Time's relentless flow, we have the tendency to become numb to his exceptional coldness. His cruelties are subtle and we become strangely accustomed to the death he inflicts only because his instruments of torture bleed us out so gradually.

Yet, suddenly, we find ourselves anemic and sick, gasping and struggling for that next breath. Life is very nearly at its end and we find ourselves horrified by the abruptness of that realization. After all, weren't we just a moment ago healthy and strong? Wasn't the ugly hag, despised and discarded, the object of desire a mere decade ago? Wasn't the broken old man, his bones aching and his organs failing, no more possibilities before him and a lifetime of regrets behind him, a healthy young man borne aloft by ambition a mere two decades prior? 

The pretty whores who performed in their pornographic shows age just as quickly as the healthy men who once masturbated to them. We all of us march forward to the grave together, driven forward by Chronos' scourge. What does it matter that some of us are closer to Death than others? We're all swallowed up by him regardless.

Whatever tortures Gehenna's flames can offer, they pale in comparison to those inflicted by the sands of Time. While the Devil takes only the hindmost, Chronos claims us all, righteous and wicked, lovely and hideous, and delights in doing so slowly.

>Being devoid of that entire aspect has never particularly bothered me, but there's a tripfag named WitchKing who's the same age as myself, he's despair incarnate, so I guess it fires differently.

I'll admit that if the testimony of my fellow wizards is to be believed, I've had a far more difficult time entering our sad little lodge than most. When I was younger and knew even then that dying a virgin would be an inevitability, I took some solace in the assurances that my libido would wane as I approached forty but, at least insofar as my own case is concerned, I'm afraid I was lied to. There's been no peace, no cooling of the passions, a gentle descent toward midnight. My twilight years are nearly over and I'm still absurdly clinging to what little light is left glowing on the horizon. We all go down to the dark but it would have been nice to have walked beneath the sun just once instead of having to pine for it while looking up from the black, subterranean places reserved for the hideous. 

I fall asleep at night and still have the silly dreams of adolescents on the verge of entering adulthood. During my laughable little sojourns down in Dreamland, I'm not revisiting old sexual conquests but instead embracing women with all the clumsiness of someone more than two decades my junior. An authentic smile from a woman, an awkward kiss: these are the substance of a wizard's dreams. And then he wakes and, glimpsing himself in the mirror, realizes his flesh has grown old while his spirit remains that of a child. Peter Pan has lost all of his pleasant thoughts, his magic has become corrupted, he can no longer fly and the tide is creeping in.

Hopefully Pan was correct when he claimed dying would be a great adventure. For a wizard unable to come to terms with his circumstance, or a monster unable to raise his head up from the ground due to the weight of the horns sprouting from his brow, death is the only adventure left remaining to him.

>What i really want to do is save people from the demons that plague them. Modern society is demonic. Should I become an exorcist? How do I exorcise people?

The desire to relieve people from the devils that haunt them is certainly an admirable sentiment. A demon is an unclean spirit, after all, something that pollutes the soul, and to be relieved of such a burden would be a wondrous thing. It's no coincidence that the foundation of Christ's popularity was his purported ability as an exorcist. The moment a heretic can deliver a man from his devils is the same moment he escapes the stake and takes his place among the saints.

Yet even Christ acknowledged the fundamental problem of exorcism: drive out a devil, and seven worse rush in replace it. Our demons are essential to us; it would be easier to drive the marrow from our bones or the blood from our veins than it would be to exile the devils from our psyche. The tutelary spirits appointed to us at birth aren't Raphael, Gabriel or Michael but rather Asmodeus, Sammael and Lucifer. 

The Spirit that seized Jesus after his baptism wasn't an angel but a monster, a carrion bird pretending to be a dove, a vicious, mad thing that drove him into the wilderness to starve. Beyond the reach of both God and Man, the offspring of both struggled with his own devil and, in the process, reconciled his impossible heritage. The priest that sanctified the marriage of Heaven and Earth was Hell.

Don't aspire to drive out a man's devils. They inflict unspeakable pain, but it's only through their black alchemy that the fragile humans they torment are offered the tiniest hope of participating in the divine.

>can ugly people ever truly be happy?

I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine regarding the plight of the truly ugly, that tiny minority of people who no one could ever possibly desire. Said friend is a devout Catholic who believes in the concept of vocation: insofar as every person is concerned, we each of us has a role in God's design. Of course, submitting to it fully is a prerequisite for happiness; one of the terrifying things about free will is the fact that it allows one license to walk down into Hell with his eyes wide open.

To the Catholics, both the religious life of the cenobite and life of the layman raising a family are valid vocations. I asked what to make of those men who want marriage, children and all the rest but are too repulsive for any woman to want marriage or children with them. He suggested the monastic life but, sadly, not every man is suited to the religious life simply because he's ugly. He desires to have children, he desires to live as most men live. In such cases, the Flesh and Spirit of the ugly find themselves in vicious conflict as long as the former draws breath in service of the latter. When a man meant for family is incapable of it by virtue of his soul, he joins the brotherhood of philanderers. When a man whose spirit is meant for family is not allowed to have one by virtue of his hideous flesh, he is baptized into the order of monsters. 

My friend had no answer to the dilemma faced by the ugly who aren't content to live as the unlovable should be. A good man, he could only offer that his heart broke for them. Which he meant in all sincerity; he cares for something as disgusting as myself, after all.

Father God and Mother Natural are both beautiful, but even lovely parents can give rise to abominations. So God, in His wisdom, gave birth to Death, the only exorcist powerful enough to drive a spirit from a body unsuited to it and, in lieu of happiness, at the very least can grant peace.

Seeing a happy man with a wife by his side condemning other men because they haven't attained what he has, the world takes upon a surreal quality. This fellow has closed his eyes for the sake of some dreamworld and, having done so, feels himself justified indicting those mourning the fact that they live in a nightmare.

The vast majority want precisely what this fellow flaunts: a loving wife, a happy family, a part, however small, in Nature's simple passion play. 

Yet seeking admittance, more and more men are being turned away; deemed unfit to take their place upon the stage, they find themselves relegated to the darkness reserved for an audience who's only option is to watch in silence. 

There was a time when the unloved were the tiniest of minorities. The abominations that had no proper role in the natural course of things were so unique that the only place one could find them was on display in some sideshow while alive and burning in Gehenna's filthy ghettos after death.

Strangely, something has changed. Perfectly normal men have undergone a baptism and have emerged from the waters as repulsive monsters. The sideshow tent no longer remains standing because a multitude has flooded into it and it's burst at the seams. 

There was a time when men lined up and paid a quarter for the privilege of glimpsing an abomination because freaks were so very rare; inheritors of Paradise, they were morbidly curious about what it would be like to burn in Hell. But Hell is now above and Heaven so very far below, and a parade of monsters line up of for the sake of seeing a human being on display, dreaming of what it would be like to spend a moment treading upon the Earth.

The gates of Hell have been flung open and a host of refugees are flooding in. As one of Perdition's natives, there's something distasteful about having to share one's ghetto with normal men. Lamentably, though we'd like to send them back, they no longer have a home to return to.

As a wizard, I'll confess I found that video disturbing. One can't help but feel vicarious hurt on the part of the silly middle-aged virgin being lampooned by what appears to be a happy couple. There's something grotesque about the healthy taking pleasure in the misery of the sick, of the living making sport of the dead.

Having said that, distasteful though such a display may seem, it's entirely understandable. 
The Living harbor a visceral antipathy toward the Dead, Beauty and all of its goodness can't help but despise Ugliness. There's no man nor woman alive who, upon seeing a monster, doesn't pray for its funeral. 

Yet we live in gentle times, don't we? Mankind has been robbed of its authority to strangle abominations while they still slumber in their cradles. A more sophisticated morality demands we permit Mother Nature's abortions to grow to full term, allow disease to blossom, give license to the things that should have been relegated to the world of nightmares to intrude into the waking world.

Placed into the unpleasant position of abiding monsters, mankind has learned how to render them innocuous. By clapping them in chains and imprisoning them in sideshows, otherwise terrifying devils are reduced to amusing freaks. Smear a hideous visage with the face paint of a clown and adorn its twisted frame in colorful rags, and the deformed dwarf that once inspired nothing but nausea now elicits laughter. 

And in this way the Jester finds himself in the presence of kings. He'll dance and make a fool of himself for the sake of being tolerated long enough to dream his next dream. Asleep, he'll remember his proper place as one of Chaos' sons. He'll remember the horns that adorned his head before the beautiful race of men wrenched them from his skull so that a silly cap with tinkling bells could be drawn over his brow.

Never forget that every laugh inspired by a dancing clown is a nervous one.

>Is this fucking thread from /x/?

We forget that, as infants, we enter this world in nearly complete darkness. Granted, light shone upon us and dragged us up out of oblivion. Yet, in those earliest moments, said light is very dim. It does little more than illumine enough of the world to show us that the vast majority belongs to the nighttime. The newborn wakes and, when presented with the endless potential offered by unfathomable darkness, is far more likely to imagine devils than he is angels. Monsters slither beneath the bed, boogeymen claw at the closet door. Upon being initiated into an ostensibly rational cosmos, the toddler's first suspicion is that, beneath all of its orderly trappings, Chaos reigns.

Time passes and the sun climbs higher. Shadows recede and monsters retreat. We commune with our fellow men and, finding nothing terrifying in them, are tricked into believing we've left our old fears in nursery to rot with the dusty fairy-stories about the things that lurk on the Nightside of the world. 

Sadly, the devils that leered at us as we slept fitfully in our cradle follow us. We'll catch a glimpse of them from the corner of our eye, if only for a moment. Hearing the story of some vicious murder or unthinkable depravity, we'll be reminded of the terrifying lullabyes that sang us to sleep during those first few years when the world was haunted and every dream was still a nightmare.

Years pass and the shadows lengthen. Death returns with all of his majesty and the geriatric becomes the vulnerable infant once again. Finally the victim himself, the old man remembers the demons of disorder that had pursued him his entire life but that he believed himself immune from because they had, for whatever reason, decided to take someone else. 

The devil claims the hindmost. That reassuring thought serves as every man's talisman until that inevitable moment when he looks over his shoulder and realizes there's no one left behind him.

>how do you get rid of the demon Asmodeus and stop him from haunting your dreams

I suppose you could always try to immolate the viscera of a fish; according to the Book of Tobit the smoke that resulted from doing so was sufficient to drive the demon away. Apparently Lord Asmodeus found the smell particularly offensive. Sort of humorous, isn't it? Such a seemingly insignificant thing was able to drive away a prince of devils.

Ridiculous, to be sure, but there's truth at the heart of even the most absurd joke. It's strange that Asmodeus is now considered the god of sexual excess, the tutelary spirit of prostitutes and patron saint of whoremongers, especially considering he was considered the villain of the Book of Tobit not because he encouraged sex but because he prevented it. According to the story, every time the heroine Sarah married, Asmodeus murdered her groom before the union could be consummated. The demon was not so much a god of sexual license as he was one of sexual frustration. By preventing the natural course of things, defying both the Creator and His design, our devil corrupted sexual desire by turning it into unsatisfied lust. 

Asmodeus haunts every man unable to experience and express sexuality according to Nature's dictates. Through his black alchemy he turns healthy impulses into sterile perversions. Whispering into the ears of the repulsive things who have no hope of participating in the beautiful, he twists the inherent adoration of what is lovely into the resentment of it. It's to this devil that every wizard is sworn to the moment he first draws breath.

However, assuming you're a man and not some abomination, it's entirely possible to slip the vicious imp. The sacrament that will deliver you will not be that of exorcism but that of marriage.

Provided, of course, that unlike one of the princes of Hell, you can endure the occasional smell of fish.

>I have no clue why people still try to cling to the incel communities once they have "ascended". Its a lonely, terrible place.

True, those communities are terrible places. However, horror you find in such places is almost magical. Having crossed the circled line into them, one finds the Natural order inverted. Whereas those who belong to the world of men vie to crown themselves the most brilliant or the most beautiful, within the sad ghettos reserved for monsters the citizens fight tooth and nail for the privilege of being considered the most repulsive. Strange, perhaps, but there's certainly a degree of logic to it. When one finds himself down in Hell, the lower one descends the closer he comes to taking his place upon its throne. If one is going to be just as unloved as an imp as he would be a satan, if one has no hope of even the simplest joy, at the very least he an aspire to be majestic in his misery. The Lord of Hell will always be less than the least significant of men but, at the very least, he can outrank the pettiest of devils.

Well, most of these "imps" slip Hell as Nature takes its course. The day comes when they smile at a woman and their gesture is reciprocated. They begin to live as nearly every person does. Stripped of their stubby horns and tiny fangs, Pandemonium casts them out into the world of men.

Our former devils expected Paradise only to find a rough world waiting for them, one of infidelity, broken hearts and tears. I have no doubt they have moments when they pine for the world they came from and all of its pristine darkness, where a tear was not a shameful thing but rather a shining jewel in one's infernal crown. 

So they return to Gehenna. if only briefly. The moment they feel the tears begin to freeze on their cheeks, they flee back to the world of men having realized that though they'll weep as both a human and devil, at least as one of the former there'll be moments when the tears they shed dry.

I've never understood how the ugly, the repulsive, the lost, unloved and left behind consider stories of aging women taking their lives because they haven't found love to be a victory.

These are attractive women, women that something like myself would consider himself blessed to have the tiniest chance of having a relationship with. Yes, they're a little bit older. There are the beginnings of wrinkles creasing the corners of their eyes and lips. Their breasts and bellies are begging to sag. What of it? We're all of us aging, all of us growing older together, dying in lockstep. The horror of marching toward infirmity, senility and, eventually, oblivion has the possibility of being rendered beautiful by taking that journey with someone beside you, her arm around your waist and her's around your's. 

Yet these women consider you an unworthy partner; having recognized night is falling they would rather watch their final sunset alone than do so clasping hands with a monster. As terrifying as Death is, he's proven to be a more desirable suitor than you could ever hope to be. Hold your arms open waiting to receive these women, just as desperate to be loved as you are and, with less than a moment of hesitation, they'll rush to Sammael's fleshless embrace.

Not even the pettiest schadenfraude can be gleaned from the realization that, given the choice between sharing a bed with you and rotting in a grave alone, a woman has chosen the latter.

>tfw ugly bot not ugly enough so people feel sorry for you
>WHY CAN'T I JUST BE A FREAK

There's a reason why charity is considered a virtue and pity a vice, and it's the same reason the former is accepted with gratitude and the latter resentfully rejected. Proper charity is one man giving to a fellow human being due to a sense of brotherhood and its an act that accomplishes some actual good. Feed another person and he ceases to be tormented by hunger pangs, offer feasible advice and you've helped him extricate from his problems. 

The difference is that pity doesn't do a whit of good for its recipients precisely because it's an empty gift offered purely for the sake of the one giving it. Men speaking kind words when it comes to the plight of monsters with whom they share no sense of kinship are doing nothing more than chanting mantras against the forces of Fate and circumstance that can damn or save, bless or curse, through the compulsion of their gentlest whim. The handsome man forces a single tear from otherwise dry eyes for the sake of the repulsive monster because it's the closest thing to humility he's capable of. We suspect, whether rightly or wrongly, that powers that govern the cosmos despise hubris; and even gods know better than to tempt the Fates. 

The superficial kindness of the lovely toward the repulsive that they hate no less than the rest of humanity is the remnant of a very old superstition, no different than the villages who would provide petty sacrifices to the goblins and other evil sprites that lurked in the periphery, the shadowy places just beyond the reach of the village's light. If you don't want to suffer disease, you give the devil of pestilence his due regardless of how fiercely you despise him. 

The pity the lovely have for the repulsive is a ward, a charm. Soothe the monster, placate it, and it'll remain in the dark, distant places where it belongs.

>I just came to the realization that I am God. This planet, the universe and all of you are only my imagination.

The last time I heard someone assert something like this was when I was a student.

The person who uttered it was a student of the fine arts. College is often depicted as a strange liminal space between adolescence and adulthood where the typical rules of right and wrong are suspended. People can at long last drink what they wish, fuck who ever they will, indulge in every vice without the fear of judgement: small sins indulged in by imps dipping their toes in the River Styx. 

But my friend had already been fucked by countless men before stepping into the halls of Academia. Sexual promiscuity passe for her, she found a far more exciting dream.

Her professors taught that God died long ago and that artists would be tasked with filling the void. The world had grown ugly and sick; it was the glorious purpose of the artists to redeem it by rendering it lovely and healthy again. 

So my friend began to consider her paintings. the majority of which depicted herself, the Newest Testament. Her nightmares became ordeals with devils and her dreams trysts with angels.

During one of our last conversations she declared that I, as well as every other person she knew, was nothing more than a figment of her imagination. I'll admit, I found the idea seductive. The Great Goddess herself sat before me, within my reach. She was a bit overweight, her eyesight somewhat dim. The Architect of the Universe who decided, in Her infinite wisdom, that I should go to the grave unloved and unwanted, could have had the song of creation issuing from her throat choked into silence had I been so inclined.

Men make very poor gods and women even worse goddesses. It's the blessing of every counterfeit deity that each authentic devil recognizes this pitiful truth and relinquishes his hammer, too sad and tired to smash an idol even emptier than himself.

Repulsive wizard though I am, one of those things who would live, grow old and die in the nursery regardless of whether he dreamed his nightmares in a rotting crib surrounded by unwanted moldy toys or in a sprawling palace adorned by coveted golden ones, even I recognize a sexual relationship is no panacea. 

A man with a diseased mind, cursed with a soul rendered morbid by infirmity, could be granted entrance into Heaven and suffer just as acutely as a healthy man condemned to Hell. Mother Nature can be exceptionally cruel to Her children, and sometimes She'll visit deformity upon the Spirit rather than the Flesh.

Angels can grow ill; incapable of experiencing the beauty that should have been their birthright as beautiful things, they stray from the delights of the Garden and become ensnared by its thorns. They smell flowers and the stench of sulfur fills their nostrils; permitted to consume the sweetest fruit, they taste nothing but ash.

That particular tragedy doesn't negate that of the the monster with a healthy spirit who would be capable of enjoying the Garden but isn't permitted entrance into it. He could enjoy a flower's scent but his nostrils are only allowed the smell of rot. The apple's sweetness is something his palate is capable of appreciating, but the fruit would rot before it would condescend to be touched by the monster's repulsive tongue.

Handsome Devil with his leprous soul and Repulsive Demon with its twisted body envy, resent and hate each other with the same frothing pathos.

Absurd, isn't it, considering that God and Nature have sentenced them to burn beside each other in Hell?

>Hope you get better though, maybe you will find a lot of happiness in solitude like the Great Desert Fathers have.

Have? Or perhaps more appropriately "had". The Desert Fathers are, and are now, and will always be gone. They were a failed experiment at one time and, that trial having run its monstrously unsuccessful course, neither exist now nor will they ever exist again.

It would be a grand testament to the power of the human spirit if it could actually exist in isolation. It would be marvelous if the spirit of a man, exorcised from his flesh, could during its long exile in the wilderness become something akin to a god. Hungry, he could devour his own flesh and somehow be satisfied, learning how to become a sacrifice upon his own altar. Desperate for a cooling rain, he could weep and wash the heat of the wicked world away. Seized by the Spirit, Jesus was driven into the desert so that he could, by enduring its agonies, learn how to become a god.

That's the myth, the fantasy, the illusory solace Nature offers to those who are relegated to the wasteland. Sadly, fairy-tales have the tendency of falling short. Christ, driven down into harsh wastelands by his divine madness, was tempted Lord Lucifer and, enduring his harsh initiation, earned the right to be considered the Son of God. And when his time of trial was complete, angels came to minster to him.

Saint Anthony wasn't provided that kind of solace. Suffering in his isolation, he prayed to God and God sent demons to torment him. He endured the tortures allotted to him and his reward was the opportunity to utter prayers so incoherent that the petitioner had no idea whether he was addressing the Queen of Heaven or the King of Hell. After a point, wild with desperation, it no longer mattered to our exile which one of the two answers.

Eventually, the Desert Philosopher expects only silence because, regardless of how loudly he cries out, neither God nor Goddess will respond with anything else.

>As a Wizard, I have an advice for my brethren: if anyone ask you this question, lie

The last thing I want is to sow discord by disagreeing with one of my brothers. Having said that, I'm afraid I'll do so just the same.

If one reaches the age of thirty and has never had a single woman desire him, his fate has been sealed. The contract's been signed, with God enthusiastically providing the pen and Nature the ink. 

If someone who belongs to the tribe of men asks a thing sworn to the race of monsters whether they're a virgin, they already know the answer. It's a question posed for the same reason humans visit a carnival and pound the panes of glass separating them from the abominations on the other side. They want to see another tear, to hear another moan. The agony of those in Hell is precious if for no other reason than it can transform the misery of men into the joy of angels. 

Thing of it is, they come expecting this elixir in an adulterated form. By eliciting an old virgin's obvious lies, they've extracted diluted tears they can swallow without singing their throats in much the same way the Protestants can only participate in the Eucharist after they've convinced themselves they're drinking grape juice and not the blood of a tortured god.

Wizards, if an actual person is bold enough to ask whether you're a virgin, tell them. You're a sacrificial animal regardless, so why lay down as a smiling lamb instead of a screaming goat? Make them earn the joy they take in your misery. Tilt their world just a bit, remind them there are those who go down to the grave completely unwanted and unloved, that your biography is more than a sad fairy-tale or the fodder for cheap comedies. 

Though small, the race of monster will always be and men will always drink themselves silly with our blood. 

At the very least, we can take pains to ensure it burns just a little bit as it trickles down their throats.
>>43292516
>Why do ugly incels claim 80% of women pursue only the top 20% of men? It's like their incel religion, even though most people know it's not true at all.

Well, perhaps closer to a myth than a religion.

The thing about most myths is that though composed of smoke and illusion, nearly all have some tiny spark of truth glowing at their heart.

It's without a doubt that there will always be some men no woman will ever want. Regardless of how magnetic their personalities, how self-assured, how dedicated to improving themselves they may be, their ugliness will preclude any woman from ever desiring them. 

These true casualties of Nature's war are far and few between. Yet there are a far greater number of reasonably attractive men who find themselves without a mate. Many are socially awkward, shy, desperate to reach out but lacking the courage to. Too fragile to risk a first rejection or too demoralized to endure a second, they invoke their sacred story. The struggles of the Garden too daunting, they assure themselves they are just as repulsive as the true abominations are and retreat to safety of dim Purgatory.

It goes without saying the legion of lost souls haunting Limbo are not the same as the tiny number of proper monsters born to Hell. Deluded by their myth, the former eventually forget that simple fact and commit the same error a gentile does whenever he mistakes a dybbuk for a devil.
>>43274826
>eventually you internalize it/embrace it to the point of which you both dont care and would still feel like a virgin even if you fucked.

As a repulsive old wizard, that point is academic for something like myself, a mere thought experiment. Which isn't to say it's not a compelling one.

The wizard comes of age in Hell, with the demons serving as his familiars both his most hated tormentors and most intimate companions. Frothing Wrath, the shameful Lust of something that feels desire that will never be reciprocated, the grinding Envy that grips one's heart with its slimy claw every time one witnesses the happiness of others you'll never participate in: these become as natural as the flow of one's breath or the rush of one's blood. They alone know your secrets, are the only witnesses to your tears on those rare occasions when you weep alone in the dead of night.

Admittedly, it would be horrifying to face the prospect of having those demons driven out; unclean though they are, this legion of wicked spirits is the closest thing to a soul the unlovable monster ever had. Tantalizing though it's light may be, crawling into Paradise would be terrifying for a thing that spent a lifetime learning how to see in Pandemonium's darkness.

It would be a frightening and dangerous journey, just as all true adventures are. Granted, it's one that will never be anything more than fantasy for the unlovable, something for them to dream about while they sleep alone. And if their visions progress into nightmares, well, they'll inevitably awake with tears drying their faces.

Denied initiation into the race of men, one of the few mysteries permitted to the abominations given to such dreams is whether the tears staining their cheeks after waking are those of joy or despair.

>No matter what achievements I earn, I am still an unhappy miserable person.

While attending college, one of my Religious Studies professors screened Peter Brooks' "Mahabharata" in his Indian Philosophy seminar. It's been more than a decade and a half since then and I remember very little of it. However, one moment in the picture remains perfectly distinct in my mind. The villain of the epic, Duryodhana, had every thing any mortal man could ever desire. He had a harem of the loveliest women willing to satisfy his every sexual whim. Each dinner he attended was a feast, every battle resulted in victory. 

For all of his apparent blessings, Duryodhana was miserable. Seeing him drowning in melancholy, on the verge of succumbing to despair, his advisers reminded him of all of the good things he should be enjoying but, for whatever reason, was incapable of finding happiness in. All of their attempts to cheer him failing, they begged their lord to tell them why he was so discontent hoping, perhaps, they could bring him joy.

Wild, in a fit of frothing rage, the king cried out: "Why am I discontented? Because I want to be discontented!"

According to the Mahabharata, Duryodhana was a son of Kali, that wicked goddess who ruled the relentless flow of time. In that respect, we're all of us brothers to the miserable king. Our mortality demands we never find permanent joy lest we grow stagnant, lest we surrender to Death while we still draw breath. 

Haunting the forums dedicated to the incels, you'll find young men lamenting their virginity. When they eventually have sex as the vast majority of men do, they mourn the fact they never had a romantic relationship during adolescence.

The moment Faust became satisfied with Life was same he lost his humanity and surrendered his soul to Hell.
>>43187857
>to the ugly/undesirable robots 
>do you think plastic surgery can fix your ugliness/unattractiveness?

I've never been comfortable with the notion of plastic surgery. Granted, it should be something any ugly man would consider a boon. If God and Nature have been stingy with their blessings, why not appeal to the alchemy of men as a recourse? When he sold his soul to Mephistopheles for the chance to experience what he never had during his long, lonely life, the good Doctor Faust was taken by his new familiar to a witch whose potions had the power to make the sorcerer young and beautiful. What does it matter if one's loveliness is artificial if it permits him to experience joys that would otherwise be impossible? 

On the face of it, there's an appeal to the fantasy of tricking your way into a Paradise that you were never intended for. Why languish in Hell when you can slip into Heaven unnoticed? 

The problem is that, when all is said and done, all of that beauty is just glamour: a hollow illusion wrought with scalpels and stitches. The monster's ugliness stains his blood; essential to his very being, it's the closest thing an abomination has to a soul. That a ghoul resents being born in Hell doesn't change the fact that it's Hell he swore an oath to the moment he drew his very first breath. Though a love-spell can permeate no deeper than the skin, true ugliness reaches to the very heart of one's being.

As a monster, I dream of what it would be like to live as men do: to be loved, to be desired, to be considered with admiration. But I'd rather mourn for the impossibility of love as a proper citizen of Pandemonium than pretend I've achieved it as a hunted fugitive in Paradise. 

The monster who refuses to wrench the horns from his skull in a futile attempt to resemble a man retains a tiny bit of dignity in the process. Attempt to do otherwise, and he sacrifices what little virtue he actually possesses for the hope of something he never will.
>>43102905
>Or does some hope still linger inside?

We all know the story of Pandora's Jar. Overwhelmed by curiosity, the most dangerous vice, the first woman broke her jar's seal to peak beneath its lid. The act, though performed without malice, unloosed evil upon the world. Sickness, strife, violence and death leaped forth and began their endless campaign to extinguish mankind. Hope, however, remained within the jar.

More optimistic reiterations of the myth consider the remaining Hope to be the element that allowed mankind to sustain itself in the face of the horrors Pandora unleashed. Though no antidote, the remaining tonic served the purpose of every anesthetic: to endure the pain that is every man's lot long enough for him to justify drawing his next breath. 

The problem with such interpretations is that, unlike the devils that escaped from the jar, Hope remained in beautiful Pandora's possession and under Her control. Though misery was inevitable for every man, respite from it certainly wasn't. The Eternal Feminine had the authority to provide a glimpse of its light or deny it as She saw fit, guarding it as fiercely as anyone would the closest thing to kindness the heartless gods had allotted to the race of men.

One only experiences Hope if lovely Pandora grants him license to. If one can imagine being loved, he is lovable. Dreams are the blessings bestowed upon men who have drawn close enough to Pandora to be bathed in the light of the Hope she guards so steadfastly. Those unworthy to step into Her presence, the things abandoned to Despair by God and Nature, have only nightmares awaiting them when they close their eyes and descend into sleep: that daily rehearsal for death that prepares men for Paradise and monsters for Hell.

Never disregard the blessing of Hope simply due to its fragility. Though there is the ever-present threat of it shattering in your trembling hands, there are those who will never look upon it, let alone touch it.

Spending our entire lives immersed in Time's relentless flow, we have the tendency to become numb to his exceptional coldness. His cruelties are subtle and we become strangely accustomed to the death he inflicts only because his instruments of torture bleed us out so gradually.

Yet, suddenly, we find ourselves anemic and sick, gasping and struggling for that next breath. Life is very nearly at its end and we find ourselves horrified by the abruptness of that realization. After all, weren't we just a moment ago healthy and strong? Wasn't the ugly hag, despised and discarded, the object of desire a mere decade ago? Wasn't the broken old man, his bones aching and his organs failing, no more possibilities before him and a lifetime of regrets behind him, a healthy young man borne aloft by ambition a mere two decades prior? 

The pretty whores who performed in their pornographic shows age just as quickly as the healthy men who once masturbated to them. We all of us march forward to the grave together, driven forward by Chronos' scourge. What does it matter that some of us are closer to Death than others? We're all swallowed up by him regardless.

Whatever tortures Gehenna's flames can offer, they pale in comparison to those inflicted by the sands of Time. While the Devil takes only the hindmost, Chronos claims us all, righteous and wicked, lovely and hideous, and delights in doing so slowly.

>Being devoid of that entire aspect has never particularly bothered me, but there's a tripfag named WitchKing who's the same age as myself, he's despair incarnate, so I guess it fires differently.

I'll admit that if the testimony of my fellow wizards is to be believed, I've had a far more difficult time entering our sad little lodge than most. When I was younger and knew even then that dying a virgin would be an inevitability, I took some solace in the assurances that my libido would wane as I approached forty but, at least insofar as my own case is concerned, I'm afraid I was lied to. There's been no peace, no cooling of the passions, a gentle descent toward midnight. My twilight years are nearly over and I'm still absurdly clinging to what little light is left glowing on the horizon. We all go down to the dark but it would have been nice to have walked beneath the sun just once instead of having to pine for it while looking up from the black, subterranean places reserved for the hideous. 

I fall asleep at night and still have the silly dreams of adolescents on the verge of entering adulthood. During my laughable little sojourns down in Dreamland, I'm not revisiting old sexual conquests but instead embracing women with all the clumsiness of someone more than two decades my junior. An authentic smile from a woman, an awkward kiss: these are the substance of a wizard's dreams. And then he wakes and, glimpsing himself in the mirror, realizes his flesh has grown old while his spirit remains that of a child. Peter Pan has lost all of his pleasant thoughts, his magic has become corrupted, he can no longer fly and the tide is creeping in.

Hopefully Pan was correct when he claimed dying would be a great adventure. For a wizard unable to come to terms with his circumstance, or a monster unable to raise his head up from the ground due to the weight of the horns sprouting from his brow, death is the only adventure left remaining to him.

>What i really want to do is save people from the demons that plague them. Modern society is demonic. Should I become an exorcist? How do I exorcise people?

The desire to relieve people from the devils that haunt them is certainly an admirable sentiment. A demon is an unclean spirit, after all, something that pollutes the soul, and to be relieved of such a burden would be a wondrous thing. It's no coincidence that the foundation of Christ's popularity was his purported ability as an exorcist. The moment a heretic can deliver a man from his devils is the same moment he escapes the stake and takes his place among the saints.

Yet even Christ acknowledged the fundamental problem of exorcism: drive out a devil, and seven worse rush in replace it. Our demons are essential to us; it would be easier to drive the marrow from our bones or the blood from our veins than it would be to exile the devils from our psyche. The tutelary spirits appointed to us at birth aren't Raphael, Gabriel or Michael but rather Asmodeus, Sammael and Lucifer. 

The Spirit that seized Jesus after his baptism wasn't an angel but a monster, a carrion bird pretending to be a dove, a vicious, mad thing that drove him into the wilderness to starve. Beyond the reach of both God and Man, the offspring of both struggled with his own devil and, in the process, reconciled his impossible heritage. The priest that sanctified the marriage of Heaven and Earth was Hell.

Don't aspire to drive out a man's devils. They inflict unspeakable pain, but it's only through their black alchemy that the fragile humans they torment are offered the tiniest hope of participating in the divine.

>can ugly people ever truly be happy?

I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine regarding the plight of the truly ugly, that tiny minority of people who no one could ever possibly desire. Said friend is a devout Catholic who believes in the concept of vocation: insofar as every person is concerned, we each of us has a role in God's design. Of course, submitting to it fully is a prerequisite for happiness; one of the terrifying things about free will is the fact that it allows one license to walk down into Hell with his eyes wide open.

To the Catholics, both the religious life of the cenobite and life of the layman raising a family are valid vocations. I asked what to make of those men who want marriage, children and all the rest but are too repulsive for any woman to want marriage or children with them. He suggested the monastic life but, sadly, not every man is suited to the religious life simply because he's ugly. He desires to have children, he desires to live as most men live. In such cases, the Flesh and Spirit of the ugly find themselves in vicious conflict as long as the former draws breath in service of the latter. When a man meant for family is incapable of it by virtue of his soul, he joins the brotherhood of philanderers. When a man whose spirit is meant for family is not allowed to have one by virtue of his hideous flesh, he is baptized into the order of monsters. 

My friend had no answer to the dilemma faced by the ugly who aren't content to live as the unlovable should be. A good man, he could only offer that his heart broke for them. Which he meant in all sincerity; he cares for something as disgusting as myself, after all.

Father God and Mother Natural are both beautiful, but even lovely parents can give rise to abominations. So God, in His wisdom, gave birth to Death, the only exorcist powerful enough to drive a spirit from a body unsuited to it and, in lieu of happiness, at the very least can grant peace.

Seeing a happy man with a wife by his side condemning other men because they haven't attained what he has, the world takes upon a surreal quality. This fellow has closed his eyes for the sake of some dreamworld and, having done so, feels himself justified indicting those mourning the fact that they live in a nightmare.

The vast majority want precisely what this fellow flaunts: a loving wife, a happy family, a part, however small, in Nature's simple passion play. 

Yet seeking admittance, more and more men are being turned away; deemed unfit to take their place upon the stage, they find themselves relegated to the darkness reserved for an audience who's only option is to watch in silence. 

There was a time when the unloved were the tiniest of minorities. The abominations that had no proper role in the natural course of things were so unique that the only place one could find them was on display in some sideshow while alive and burning in Gehenna's filthy ghettos after death.

Strangely, something has changed. Perfectly normal men have undergone a baptism and have emerged from the waters as repulsive monsters. The sideshow tent no longer remains standing because a multitude has flooded into it and it's burst at the seams. 

There was a time when men lined up and paid a quarter for the privilege of glimpsing an abomination because freaks were so very rare; inheritors of Paradise, they were morbidly curious about what it would be like to burn in Hell. But Hell is now above and Heaven so very far below, and a parade of monsters line up of for the sake of seeing a human being on display, dreaming of what it would be like to spend a moment treading upon the Earth.

The gates of Hell have been flung open and a host of refugees are flooding in. As one of Perdition's natives, there's something distasteful about having to share one's ghetto with normal men. Lamentably, though we'd like to send them back, they no longer have a home to return to.

As a wizard, I'll confess I found that video disturbing. One can't help but feel vicarious hurt on the part of the silly middle-aged virgin being lampooned by what appears to be a happy couple. There's something grotesque about the healthy taking pleasure in the misery of the sick, of the living making sport of the dead.

Having said that, distasteful though such a display may seem, it's entirely understandable. 
The Living harbor a visceral antipathy toward the Dead, Beauty and all of its goodness can't help but despise Ugliness. There's no man nor woman alive who, upon seeing a monster, doesn't pray for its funeral. 

Yet we live in gentle times, don't we? Mankind has been robbed of its authority to strangle abominations while they still slumber in their cradles. A more sophisticated morality demands we permit Mother Nature's abortions to grow to full term, allow disease to blossom, give license to the things that should have been relegated to the world of nightmares to intrude into the waking world.

Placed into the unpleasant position of abiding monsters, mankind has learned how to render them innocuous. By clapping them in chains and imprisoning them in sideshows, otherwise terrifying devils are reduced to amusing freaks. Smear a hideous visage with the face paint of a clown and adorn its twisted frame in colorful rags, and the deformed dwarf that once inspired nothing but nausea now elicits laughter. 

And in this way the Jester finds himself in the presence of kings. He'll dance and make a fool of himself for the sake of being tolerated long enough to dream his next dream. Asleep, he'll remember his proper place as one of Chaos' sons. He'll remember the horns that adorned his head before the beautiful race of men wrenched them from his skull so that a silly cap with tinkling bells could be drawn over his brow.

Never forget that every laugh inspired by a dancing clown is a nervous one.

>Is this fucking thread from /x/?

We forget that, as infants, we enter this world in nearly complete darkness. Granted, light shone upon us and dragged us up out of oblivion. Yet, in those earliest moments, said light is very dim. It does little more than illumine enough of the world to show us that the vast majority belongs to the nighttime. The newborn wakes and, when presented with the endless potential offered by unfathomable darkness, is far more likely to imagine devils than he is angels. Monsters slither beneath the bed, boogeymen claw at the closet door. Upon being initiated into an ostensibly rational cosmos, the toddler's first suspicion is that, beneath all of its orderly trappings, Chaos reigns.

Time passes and the sun climbs higher. Shadows recede and monsters retreat. We commune with our fellow men and, finding nothing terrifying in them, are tricked into believing we've left our old fears in nursery to rot with the dusty fairy-stories about the things that lurk on the Nightside of the world. 

Sadly, the devils that leered at us as we slept fitfully in our cradle follow us. We'll catch a glimpse of them from the corner of our eye, if only for a moment. Hearing the story of some vicious murder or unthinkable depravity, we'll be reminded of the terrifying lullabyes that sang us to sleep during those first few years when the world was haunted and every dream was still a nightmare.

Years pass and the shadows lengthen. Death returns with all of his majesty and the geriatric becomes the vulnerable infant once again. Finally the victim himself, the old man remembers the demons of disorder that had pursued him his entire life but that he believed himself immune from because they had, for whatever reason, decided to take someone else. 

The devil claims the hindmost. That reassuring thought serves as every man's talisman until that inevitable moment when he looks over his shoulder and realizes there's no one left behind him.

>how do you get rid of the demon Asmodeus and stop him from haunting your dreams

I suppose you could always try to immolate the viscera of a fish; according to the Book of Tobit the smoke that resulted from doing so was sufficient to drive the demon away. Apparently Lord Asmodeus found the smell particularly offensive. Sort of humorous, isn't it? Such a seemingly insignificant thing was able to drive away a prince of devils.

Ridiculous, to be sure, but there's truth at the heart of even the most absurd joke. It's strange that Asmodeus is now considered the god of sexual excess, the tutelary spirit of prostitutes and patron saint of whoremongers, especially considering he was considered the villain of the Book of Tobit not because he encouraged sex but because he prevented it. According to the story, every time the heroine Sarah married, Asmodeus murdered her groom before the union could be consummated. The demon was not so much a god of sexual license as he was one of sexual frustration. By preventing the natural course of things, defying both the Creator and His design, our devil corrupted sexual desire by turning it into unsatisfied lust. 

Asmodeus haunts every man unable to experience and express sexuality according to Nature's dictates. Through his black alchemy he turns healthy impulses into sterile perversions. Whispering into the ears of the repulsive things who have no hope of participating in the beautiful, he twists the inherent adoration of what is lovely into the resentment of it. It's to this devil that every wizard is sworn to the moment he first draws breath.

However, assuming you're a man and not some abomination, it's entirely possible to slip the vicious imp. The sacrament that will deliver you will not be that of exorcism but that of marriage.

Provided, of course, that unlike one of the princes of Hell, you can endure the occasional smell of fish.
>>42569652
>I have no clue why people still try to cling to the incel communities once they have "ascended". Its a lonely, terrible place.

True, those communities are terrible places. However, horror you find in such places is almost magical. Having crossed the circled line into them, one finds the Natural order inverted. Whereas those who belong to the world of men vie to crown themselves the most brilliant or the most beautiful, within the sad ghettos reserved for monsters the citizens fight tooth and nail for the privilege of being considered the most repulsive. Strange, perhaps, but there's certainly a degree of logic to it. When one finds himself down in Hell, the lower one descends the closer he comes to taking his place upon its throne. If one is going to be just as unloved as an imp as he would be a satan, if one has no hope of even the simplest joy, at the very least he an aspire to be majestic in his misery. The Lord of Hell will always be less than the least significant of men but, at the very least, he can outrank the pettiest of devils.

Well, most of these "imps" slip Hell as Nature takes its course. The day comes when they smile at a woman and their gesture is reciprocated. They begin to live as nearly every person does. Stripped of their stubby horns and tiny fangs, Pandemonium casts them out into the world of men.

Our former devils expected Paradise only to find a rough world waiting for them, one of infidelity, broken hearts and tears. I have no doubt they have moments when they pine for the world they came from and all of its pristine darkness, where a tear was not a shameful thing but rather a shining jewel in one's infernal crown. 

So they return to Gehenna. if only briefly. The moment they feel the tears begin to freeze on their cheeks, they flee back to the world of men having realized that though they'll weep as both a human and devil, at least as one of the former there'll be moments when the tears they shed dry.

I've never understood how the ugly, the repulsive, the lost, unloved and left behind consider stories of aging women taking their lives because they haven't found love to be a victory.

These are attractive women, women that something like myself would consider himself blessed to have the tiniest chance of having a relationship with. Yes, they're a little bit older. There are the beginnings of wrinkles creasing the corners of their eyes and lips. Their breasts and bellies are begging to sag. What of it? We're all of us aging, all of us growing older together, dying in lockstep. The horror of marching toward infirmity, senility and, eventually, oblivion has the possibility of being rendered beautiful by taking that journey with someone beside you, her arm around your waist and her's around your's. 

Yet these women consider you an unworthy partner; having recognized night is falling they would rather watch their final sunset alone than do so clasping hands with a monster. As terrifying as Death is, he's proven to be a more desirable suitor than you could ever hope to be. Hold your arms open waiting to receive these women, just as desperate to be loved as you are and, with less than a moment of hesitation, they'll rush to Sammael's fleshless embrace.

Not even the pettiest schadenfraude can be gleaned from the realization that, given the choice between sharing a bed with you and rotting in a grave alone, a woman has chosen the latter.

>tfw ugly bot not ugly enough so people feel sorry for you
>WHY CAN'T I JUST BE A FREAK

There's a reason why charity is considered a virtue and pity a vice, and it's the same reason the former is accepted with gratitude and the latter resentfully rejected. Proper charity is one man giving to a fellow human being due to a sense of brotherhood and its an act that accomplishes some actual good. Feed another person and he ceases to be tormented by hunger pangs, offer feasible advice and you've helped him extricate from his problems. 

The difference is that pity doesn't do a whit of good for its recipients precisely because it's an empty gift offered purely for the sake of the one giving it. Men speaking kind words when it comes to the plight of monsters with whom they share no sense of kinship are doing nothing more than chanting mantras against the forces of Fate and circumstance that can damn or save, bless or curse, through the compulsion of their gentlest whim. The handsome man forces a single tear from otherwise dry eyes for the sake of the repulsive monster because it's the closest thing to humility he's capable of. We suspect, whether rightly or wrongly, that powers that govern the cosmos despise hubris; and even gods know better than to tempt the Fates. 

The superficial kindness of the lovely toward the repulsive that they hate no less than the rest of humanity is the remnant of a very old superstition, no different than the villages who would provide petty sacrifices to the goblins and other evil sprites that lurked in the periphery, the shadowy places just beyond the reach of the village's light. If you don't want to suffer disease, you give the devil of pestilence his due regardless of how fiercely you despise him. 

The pity the lovely have for the repulsive is a ward, a charm. Soothe the monster, placate it, and it'll remain in the dark, distant places where it belongs.

>I just came to the realization that I am God. This planet, the universe and all of you are only my imagination.

The last time I heard someone assert something like this was when I was a student.

The person who uttered it was a student of the fine arts. College is often depicted as a strange liminal space between adolescence and adulthood where the typical rules of right and wrong are suspended. People can at long last drink what they wish, fuck who ever they will, indulge in every vice without the fear of judgement: small sins indulged in by imps dipping their toes in the River Styx. 

But my friend had already been fucked by countless men before stepping into the halls of Academia. Sexual promiscuity passe for her, she found a far more exciting dream.

Her professors taught that God died long ago and that artists would be tasked with filling the void. The world had grown ugly and sick; it was the glorious purpose of the artists to redeem it by rendering it lovely and healthy again. 

So my friend began to consider her paintings. the majority of which depicted herself, the Newest Testament. Her nightmares became ordeals with devils and her dreams trysts with angels.

During one of our last conversations she declared that I, as well as every other person she knew, was nothing more than a figment of her imagination. I'll admit, I found the idea seductive. The Great Goddess herself sat before me, within my reach. She was a bit overweight, her eyesight somewhat dim. The Architect of the Universe who decided, in Her infinite wisdom, that I should go to the grave unloved and unwanted, could have had the song of creation issuing from her throat choked into silence had I been so inclined.

Men make very poor gods and women even worse goddesses. It's the blessing of every counterfeit deity that each authentic devil recognizes this pitiful truth and relinquishes his hammer, too sad and tired to smash an idol even emptier than himself.

Repulsive wizard though I am, one of those things who would live, grow old and die in the nursery regardless of whether he dreamed his nightmares in a rotting crib surrounded by unwanted moldy toys or in a sprawling palace adorned by coveted golden ones, even I recognize a sexual relationship is no panacea. 

A man with a diseased mind, cursed with a soul rendered morbid by infirmity, could be granted entrance into Heaven and suffer just as acutely as a healthy man condemned to Hell. Mother Nature can be exceptionally cruel to Her children, and sometimes She'll visit deformity upon the Spirit rather than the Flesh.

Angels can grow ill; incapable of experiencing the beauty that should have been their birthright as beautiful things, they stray from the delights of the Garden and become ensnared by its thorns. They smell flowers and the stench of sulfur fills their nostrils; permitted to consume the sweetest fruit, they taste nothing but ash.

That particular tragedy doesn't negate that of the the monster with a healthy spirit who would be capable of enjoying the Garden but isn't permitted entrance into it. He could enjoy a flower's scent but his nostrils are only allowed the smell of rot. The apple's sweetness is something his palate is capable of appreciating, but the fruit would rot before it would condescend to be touched by the monster's repulsive tongue.

Handsome Devil with his leprous soul and Repulsive Demon with its twisted body envy, resent and hate each other with the same frothing pathos.

Absurd, isn't it, considering that God and Nature have sentenced them to burn beside each other in Hell?

Have? Or perhaps more appropriately "had". The Desert Fathers are, and are now, and will always be gone. They were a failed experiment at one time and, that trial having run its monstrously unsuccessful course, neither exist now nor will they ever exist again.

It would be a grand testament to the power of the human spirit if it could actually exist in isolation. It would be marvelous if the spirit of a man, exorcised from his flesh, could during its long exile in the wilderness become something akin to a god. Hungry, he could devour his own flesh and somehow be satisfied, learning how to become a sacrifice upon his own altar. Desperate for a cooling rain, he could weep and wash the heat of the wicked world away. Seized by the Spirit, Jesus was driven into the desert so that he could, by enduring its agonies, learn how to become a god.

That's the myth, the fantasy, the illusory solace Nature offers to those who are relegated to the wasteland. Sadly, fairy-tales have the tendency of falling short. Christ, driven down into harsh wastelands by his divine madness, was tempted Lord Lucifer and, enduring his harsh initiation, earned the right to be considered the Son of God. And when his time of trial was complete, angels came to minster to him.

Saint Anthony wasn't provided that kind of solace. Suffering in his isolation, he prayed to God and God sent demons to torment him. He endured the tortures allotted to him and his reward was the opportunity to utter prayers so incoherent that the petitioner had no idea whether he was addressing the Queen of Heaven or the King of Hell. After a point, wild with desperation, it no longer mattered to our exile which one of the two answers.

Eventually, the Desert Philosopher expects only silence because, regardless of how loudly he cries out, neither God nor Goddess will respond with anything else.

>As a Wizard, I have an advice for my brethren: if anyone ask you this question, lie

The last thing I want is to sow discord by disagreeing with one of my brothers. Having said that, I'm afraid I'll do so just the same.

If one reaches the age of thirty and has never had a single woman desire him, his fate has been sealed. The contract's been signed, with God enthusiastically providing the pen and Nature the ink. 

If someone who belongs to the tribe of men asks a thing sworn to the race of monsters whether they're a virgin, they already know the answer. It's a question posed for the same reason humans visit a carnival and pound the panes of glass separating them from the abominations on the other side. They want to see another tear, to hear another moan. The agony of those in Hell is precious if for no other reason than it can transform the misery of men into the joy of angels. 

Thing of it is, they come expecting this elixir in an adulterated form. By eliciting an old virgin's obvious lies, they've extracted diluted tears they can swallow without singing their throats in much the same way the Protestants can only participate in the Eucharist after they've convinced themselves they're drinking grape juice and not the blood of a tortured god.

Wizards, if an actual person is bold enough to ask whether you're a virgin, tell them. You're a sacrificial animal regardless, so why lay down as a smiling lamb instead of a screaming goat? Make them earn the joy they take in your misery. Tilt their world just a bit, remind them there are those who go down to the grave completely unwanted and unloved, that your biography is more than a sad fairy-tale or the fodder for cheap comedies. 

Though small, the race of monster will always be and men will always drink themselves silly with our blood. 

At the very least, we can take pains to ensure it burns just a little bit as it trickles down their throats.

>Why do ugly incels claim 80% of women pursue only the top 20% of men? It's like their incel religion, even though most people know it's not true at all.

Well, perhaps closer to a myth than a religion.

The thing about most myths is that though composed of smoke and illusion, nearly all have some tiny spark of truth glowing at their heart.

It's without a doubt that there will always be some men no woman will ever want. Regardless of how magnetic their personalities, how self-assured, how dedicated to improving themselves they may be, their ugliness will preclude any woman from ever desiring them. 

These true casualties of Nature's war are far and few between. Yet there are a far greater number of reasonably attractive men who find themselves without a mate. Many are socially awkward, shy, desperate to reach out but lacking the courage to. Too fragile to risk a first rejection or too demoralized to endure a second, they invoke their sacred story. The struggles of the Garden too daunting, they assure themselves they are just as repulsive as the true abominations are and retreat to safety of dim Purgatory.

It goes without saying the legion of lost souls haunting Limbo are not the same as the tiny number of proper monsters born to Hell. Deluded by their myth, the former eventually forget that simple fact and commit the same error a gentile does whenever he mistakes a dybbuk for a devil.

>eventually you internalize it/embrace it to the point of which you both dont care and would still feel like a virgin even if you fucked.

As a repulsive old wizard, that point is academic for something like myself, a mere thought experiment. Which isn't to say it's not a compelling one.

The wizard comes of age in Hell, with the demons serving as his familiars both his most hated tormentors and most intimate companions. Frothing Wrath, the shameful Lust of something that feels desire that will never be reciprocated, the grinding Envy that grips one's heart with its slimy claw every time one witnesses the happiness of others you'll never participate in: these become as natural as the flow of one's breath or the rush of one's blood. They alone know your secrets, are the only witnesses to your tears on those rare occasions when you weep alone in the dead of night.

Admittedly, it would be horrifying to face the prospect of having those demons driven out; unclean though they are, this legion of wicked spirits is the closest thing to a soul the unlovable monster ever had. Tantalizing though it's light may be, crawling into Paradise would be terrifying for a thing that spent a lifetime learning how to see in Pandemonium's darkness.

It would be a frightening and dangerous journey, just as all true adventures are. Granted, it's one that will never be anything more than fantasy for the unlovable, something for them to dream about while they sleep alone. And if their visions progress into nightmares, well, they'll inevitably awake with tears drying their faces.

Denied initiation into the race of men, one of the few mysteries permitted to the abominations given to such dreams is whether the tears staining their cheeks after waking are those of joy or despair.

>No matter what achievements I earn, I am still an unhappy miserable person.

While attending college, one of my Religious Studies professors screened Peter Brooks' "Mahabharata" in his Indian Philosophy seminar. It's been more than a decade and a half since then and I remember very little of it. However, one moment in the picture remains perfectly distinct in my mind. The villain of the epic, Duryodhana, had every thing any mortal man could ever desire. He had a harem of the loveliest women willing to satisfy his every sexual whim. Each dinner he attended was a feast, every battle resulted in victory. 

For all of his apparent blessings, Duryodhana was miserable. Seeing him drowning in melancholy, on the verge of succumbing to despair, his advisers reminded him of all of the good things he should be enjoying but, for whatever reason, was incapable of finding happiness in. All of their attempts to cheer him failing, they begged their lord to tell them why he was so discontent hoping, perhaps, they could bring him joy.

Wild, in a fit of frothing rage, the king cried out: "Why am I discontented? Because I want to be discontented!"

According to the Mahabharata, Duryodhana was a son of Kali, that wicked goddess who ruled the relentless flow of time. In that respect, we're all of us brothers to the miserable king. Our mortality demands we never find permanent joy lest we grow stagnant, lest we surrender to Death while we still draw breath. 

Haunting the forums dedicated to the incels, you'll find young men lamenting their virginity. When they eventually have sex as the vast majority of men do, they mourn the fact they never had a romantic relationship during adolescence.

The moment Faust became satisfied with Life was same he lost his humanity and surrendered his soul to Hell.
>>43187857
>to the ugly/undesirable robots 
>do you think plastic surgery can fix your ugliness/unattractiveness?

I've never been comfortable with the notion of plastic surgery. Granted, it should be something any ugly man would consider a boon. If God and Nature have been stingy with their blessings, why not appeal to the alchemy of men as a recourse? When he sold his soul to Mephistopheles for the chance to experience what he never had during his long, lonely life, the good Doctor Faust was taken by his new familiar to a witch whose potions had the power to make the sorcerer young and beautiful. What does it matter if one's loveliness is artificial if it permits him to experience joys that would otherwise be impossible? 

On the face of it, there's an appeal to the fantasy of tricking your way into a Paradise that you were never intended for. Why languish in Hell when you can slip into Heaven unnoticed? 

The problem is that, when all is said and done, all of that beauty is just glamour: a hollow illusion wrought with scalpels and stitches. The monster's ugliness stains his blood; essential to his very being, it's the closest thing an abomination has to a soul. That a ghoul resents being born in Hell doesn't change the fact that it's Hell he swore an oath to the moment he drew his very first breath. Though a love-spell can permeate no deeper than the skin, true ugliness reaches to the very heart of one's being.

As a monster, I dream of what it would be like to live as men do: to be loved, to be desired, to be considered with admiration. But I'd rather mourn for the impossibility of love as a proper citizen of Pandemonium than pretend I've achieved it as a hunted fugitive in Paradise. 

The monster who refuses to wrench the horns from his skull in a futile attempt to resemble a man retains a tiny bit of dignity in the process. Attempt to do otherwise, and he sacrifices what little virtue he actually possesses for the hope of something he never will.
>>43102905
>Or does some hope still linger inside?

We all know the story of Pandora's Jar. Overwhelmed by curiosity, the most dangerous vice, the first woman broke her jar's seal to peak beneath its lid. The act, though performed without malice, unloosed evil upon the world. Sickness, strife, violence and death leaped forth and began their endless campaign to extinguish mankind. Hope, however, remained within the jar.

More optimistic reiterations of the myth consider the remaining Hope to be the element that allowed mankind to sustain itself in the face of the horrors Pandora unleashed. Though no antidote, the remaining tonic served the purpose of every anesthetic: to endure the pain that is every man's lot long enough for him to justify drawing his next breath. 

The problem with such interpretations is that, unlike the devils that escaped from the jar, Hope remained in beautiful Pandora's possession and under Her control. Though misery was inevitable for every man, respite from it certainly wasn't. The Eternal Feminine had the authority to provide a glimpse of its light or deny it as She saw fit, guarding it as fiercely as anyone would the closest thing to kindness the heartless gods had allotted to the race of men.

One only experiences Hope if lovely Pandora grants him license to. If one can imagine being loved, he is lovable. Dreams are the blessings bestowed upon men who have drawn close enough to Pandora to be bathed in the light of the Hope she guards so steadfastly. Those unworthy to step into Her presence, the things abandoned to Despair by God and Nature, have only nightmares awaiting them when they close their eyes and descend into sleep: that daily rehearsal for death that prepares men for Paradise and monsters for Hell.

Never disregard the blessing of Hope simply due to its fragility. Though there is the ever-present threat of it shattering in your trembling hands, there are those who will never look upon it, let alone touch it.

>Holy fuck. In the time it took me to graduate college and start my career, these chicks went from "prime of their life" to "no one cares ever again." 

It's absurd that a god like Dionysus was considered the divine embodiment of frenzy or Moloch that of wild, ravenous hunger when Chronos exceeded them both. 

Spending our entire lives immersed in Time's relentless flow, we have the tendency to become numb to his exceptional coldness. His cruelties are subtle and we become strangely accustomed to the death he inflicts only because his instruments of torture bleed us out so gradually.

Yet, suddenly, we find ourselves anemic and sick, gasping and struggling for that next breath. Life is very nearly at its end and we find ourselves horrified by the abruptness of that realization. After all, weren't we just a moment ago healthy and strong? Wasn't the ugly hag, despised and discarded, the object of desire a mere decade ago? Wasn't the broken old man, his bones aching and his organs failing, no more possibilities before him and a lifetime of regrets behind him, a healthy young man borne aloft by ambition a mere two decades prior? 

The pretty whores who performed in their pornographic shows age just as quickly as the healthy men who once masturbated to them. We all of us march forward to the grave together, driven forward by Chronos' scourge. What does it matter that some of us are closer to Death than others? We're all swallowed up by him regardless.

Whatever tortures Gehenna's flames can offer, they pale in comparison to those inflicted by the sands of Time. While the Devil takes only the hindmost, Chronos claims us all, righteous and wicked, lovely and hideous, and delights in doing so slowly.

>Being devoid of that entire aspect has never particularly bothered me, but there's a tripfag named WitchKing who's the same age as myself, he's despair incarnate, so I guess it fires differently.

I'll admit that if the testimony of my fellow wizards is to be believed, I've had a far more difficult time entering our sad little lodge than most. When I was younger and knew even then that dying a virgin would be an inevitability, I took some solace in the assurances that my libido would wane as I approached forty but, at least insofar as my own case is concerned, I'm afraid I was lied to. There's been no peace, no cooling of the passions, a gentle descent toward midnight. My twilight years are nearly over and I'm still absurdly clinging to what little light is left glowing on the horizon. We all go down to the dark but it would have been nice to have walked beneath the sun just once instead of having to pine for it while looking up from the black, subterranean places reserved for the hideous. 

I fall asleep at night and still have the silly dreams of adolescents on the verge of entering adulthood. During my laughable little sojourns down in Dreamland, I'm not revisiting old sexual conquests but instead embracing women with all the clumsiness of someone more than two decades my junior. An authentic smile from a woman, an awkward kiss: these are the substance of a wizard's dreams. And then he wakes and, glimpsing himself in the mirror, realizes his flesh has grown old while his spirit remains that of a child. Peter Pan has lost all of his pleasant thoughts, his magic has become corrupted, he can no longer fly and the tide is creeping in.

Hopefully Pan was correct when he claimed dying would be a great adventure. For a wizard unable to come to terms with his circumstance, or a monster unable to raise his head up from the ground due to the weight of the horns sprouting from his brow, death is the only adventure left remaining to him.

>What i really want to do is save people from the demons that plague them. Modern society is demonic. Should I become an exorcist? How do I exorcise people?

The desire to relieve people from the devils that haunt them is certainly an admirable sentiment. A demon is an unclean spirit, after all, something that pollutes the soul, and to be relieved of such a burden would be a wondrous thing. It's no coincidence that the foundation of Christ's popularity was his purported ability as an exorcist. The moment a heretic can deliver a man from his devils is the same moment he escapes the stake and takes his place among the saints.

Yet even Christ acknowledged the fundamental problem of exorcism: drive out a devil, and seven worse rush in replace it. Our demons are essential to us; it would be easier to drive the marrow from our bones or the blood from our veins than it would be to exile the devils from our psyche. The tutelary spirits appointed to us at birth aren't Raphael, Gabriel or Michael but rather Asmodeus, Sammael and Lucifer. 

The Spirit that seized Jesus after his baptism wasn't an angel but a monster, a carrion bird pretending to be a dove, a vicious, mad thing that drove him into the wilderness to starve. Beyond the reach of both God and Man, the offspring of both struggled with his own devil and, in the process, reconciled his impossible heritage. The priest that sanctified the marriage of Heaven and Earth was Hell.

Don't aspire to drive out a man's devils. They inflict unspeakable pain, but it's only through their black alchemy that the fragile humans they torment are offered the tiniest hope of participating in the divine.

>can ugly people ever truly be happy?

I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine regarding the plight of the truly ugly, that tiny minority of people who no one could ever possibly desire. Said friend is a devout Catholic who believes in the concept of vocation: insofar as every person is concerned, we each of us has a role in God's design. Of course, submitting to it fully is a prerequisite for happiness; one of the terrifying things about free will is the fact that it allows one license to walk down into Hell with his eyes wide open.

To the Catholics, both the religious life of the cenobite and life of the layman raising a family are valid vocations. I asked what to make of those men who want marriage, children and all the rest but are too repulsive for any woman to want marriage or children with them. He suggested the monastic life but, sadly, not every man is suited to the religious life simply because he's ugly. He desires to have children, he desires to live as most men live. In such cases, the Flesh and Spirit of the ugly find themselves in vicious conflict as long as the former draws breath in service of the latter. When a man meant for family is incapable of it by virtue of his soul, he joins the brotherhood of philanderers. When a man whose spirit is meant for family is not allowed to have one by virtue of his hideous flesh, he is baptized into the order of monsters. 

My friend had no answer to the dilemma faced by the ugly who aren't content to live as the unlovable should be. A good man, he could only offer that his heart broke for them. Which he meant in all sincerity; he cares for something as disgusting as myself, after all.

Father God and Mother Natural are both beautiful, but even lovely parents can give rise to abominations. So God, in His wisdom, gave birth to Death, the only exorcist powerful enough to drive a spirit from a body unsuited to it and, in lieu of happiness, at the very least can grant peace.

Seeing a happy man with a wife by his side condemning other men because they haven't attained what he has, the world takes upon a surreal quality. This fellow has closed his eyes for the sake of some dreamworld and, having done so, feels himself justified indicting those mourning the fact that they live in a nightmare.

The vast majority want precisely what this fellow flaunts: a loving wife, a happy family, a part, however small, in Nature's simple passion play. 

Yet seeking admittance, more and more men are being turned away; deemed unfit to take their place upon the stage, they find themselves relegated to the darkness reserved for an audience who's only option is to watch in silence. 

There was a time when the unloved were the tiniest of minorities. The abominations that had no proper role in the natural course of things were so unique that the only place one could find them was on display in some sideshow while alive and burning in Gehenna's filthy ghettos after death.

Strangely, something has changed. Perfectly normal men have undergone a baptism and have emerged from the waters as repulsive monsters. The sideshow tent no longer remains standing because a multitude has flooded into it and it's burst at the seams. 

There was a time when men lined up and paid a quarter for the privilege of glimpsing an abomination because freaks were so very rare; inheritors of Paradise, they were morbidly curious about what it would be like to burn in Hell. But Hell is now above and Heaven so very far below, and a parade of monsters line up of for the sake of seeing a human being on display, dreaming of what it would be like to spend a moment treading upon the Earth.

The gates of Hell have been flung open and a host of refugees are flooding in. As one of Perdition's natives, there's something distasteful about having to share one's ghetto with normal men. Lamentably, though we'd like to send them back, they no longer have a home to return to.

As a wizard, I'll confess I found that video disturbing. One can't help but feel vicarious hurt on the part of the silly middle-aged virgin being lampooned by what appears to be a happy couple. There's something grotesque about the healthy taking pleasure in the misery of the sick, of the living making sport of the dead.

Having said that, distasteful though such a display may seem, it's entirely understandable. 
The Living harbor a visceral antipathy toward the Dead, Beauty and all of its goodness can't help but despise Ugliness. There's no man nor woman alive who, upon seeing a monster, doesn't pray for its funeral. 

Yet we live in gentle times, don't we? Mankind has been robbed of its authority to strangle abominations while they still slumber in their cradles. A more sophisticated morality demands we permit Mother Nature's abortions to grow to full term, allow disease to blossom, give license to the things that should have been relegated to the world of nightmares to intrude into the waking world.

Placed into the unpleasant position of abiding monsters, mankind has learned how to render them innocuous. By clapping them in chains and imprisoning them in sideshows, otherwise terrifying devils are reduced to amusing freaks. Smear a hideous visage with the face paint of a clown and adorn its twisted frame in colorful rags, and the deformed dwarf that once inspired nothing but nausea now elicits laughter. 

And in this way the Jester finds himself in the presence of kings. He'll dance and make a fool of himself for the sake of being tolerated long enough to dream his next dream. Asleep, he'll remember his proper place as one of Chaos' sons. He'll remember the horns that adorned his head before the beautiful race of men wrenched them from his skull so that a silly cap with tinkling bells could be drawn over his brow.

Never forget that every laugh inspired by a dancing clown is a nervous one.

>Is this fucking thread from /x/?

We forget that, as infants, we enter this world in nearly complete darkness. Granted, light shone upon us and dragged us up out of oblivion. Yet, in those earliest moments, said light is very dim. It does little more than illumine enough of the world to show us that the vast majority belongs to the nighttime. The newborn wakes and, when presented with the endless potential offered by unfathomable darkness, is far more likely to imagine devils than he is angels. Monsters slither beneath the bed, boogeymen claw at the closet door. Upon being initiated into an ostensibly rational cosmos, the toddler's first suspicion is that, beneath all of its orderly trappings, Chaos reigns.

Time passes and the sun climbs higher. Shadows recede and monsters retreat. We commune with our fellow men and, finding nothing terrifying in them, are tricked into believing we've left our old fears in nursery to rot with the dusty fairy-stories about the things that lurk on the Nightside of the world. 

Sadly, the devils that leered at us as we slept fitfully in our cradle follow us. We'll catch a glimpse of them from the corner of our eye, if only for a moment. Hearing the story of some vicious murder or unthinkable depravity, we'll be reminded of the terrifying lullabyes that sang us to sleep during those first few years when the world was haunted and every dream was still a nightmare.

Years pass and the shadows lengthen. Death returns with all of his majesty and the geriatric becomes the vulnerable infant once again. Finally the victim himself, the old man remembers the demons of disorder that had pursued him his entire life but that he believed himself immune from because they had, for whatever reason, decided to take someone else. 

The devil claims the hindmost. That reassuring thought serves as every man's talisman until that inevitable moment when he looks over his shoulder and realizes there's no one left behind him.

>how do you get rid of the demon Asmodeus and stop him from haunting your dreams

I suppose you could always try to immolate the viscera of a fish; according to the Book of Tobit the smoke that resulted from doing so was sufficient to drive the demon away. Apparently Lord Asmodeus found the smell particularly offensive. Sort of humorous, isn't it? Such a seemingly insignificant thing was able to drive away a prince of devils.

Ridiculous, to be sure, but there's truth at the heart of even the most absurd joke. It's strange that Asmodeus is now considered the god of sexual excess, the tutelary spirit of prostitutes and patron saint of whoremongers, especially considering he was considered the villain of the Book of Tobit not because he encouraged sex but because he prevented it. According to the story, every time the heroine Sarah married, Asmodeus murdered her groom before the union could be consummated. The demon was not so much a god of sexual license as he was one of sexual frustration. By preventing the natural course of things, defying both the Creator and His design, our devil corrupted sexual desire by turning it into unsatisfied lust. 

Asmodeus haunts every man unable to experience and express sexuality according to Nature's dictates. Through his black alchemy he turns healthy impulses into sterile perversions. Whispering into the ears of the repulsive things who have no hope of participating in the beautiful, he twists the inherent adoration of what is lovely into the resentment of it. It's to this devil that every wizard is sworn to the moment he first draws breath.

However, assuming you're a man and not some abomination, it's entirely possible to slip the vicious imp. The sacrament that will deliver you will not be that of exorcism but that of marriage.

Provided, of course, that unlike one of the princes of Hell, you can endure the occasional smell of fish.

>I have no clue why people still try to cling to the incel communities once they have "ascended". Its a lonely, terrible place.

True, those communities are terrible places. However, horror you find in such places is almost magical. Having crossed the circled line into them, one finds the Natural order inverted. Whereas those who belong to the world of men vie to crown themselves the most brilliant or the most beautiful, within the sad ghettos reserved for monsters the citizens fight tooth and nail for the privilege of being considered the most repulsive. Strange, perhaps, but there's certainly a degree of logic to it. When one finds himself down in Hell, the lower one descends the closer he comes to taking his place upon its throne. If one is going to be just as unloved as an imp as he would be a satan, if one has no hope of even the simplest joy, at the very least he an aspire to be majestic in his misery. The Lord of Hell will always be less than the least significant of men but, at the very least, he can outrank the pettiest of devils.

Well, most of these "imps" slip Hell as Nature takes its course. The day comes when they smile at a woman and their gesture is reciprocated. They begin to live as nearly every person does. Stripped of their stubby horns and tiny fangs, Pandemonium casts them out into the world of men.

Our former devils expected Paradise only to find a rough world waiting for them, one of infidelity, broken hearts and tears. I have no doubt they have moments when they pine for the world they came from and all of its pristine darkness, where a tear was not a shameful thing but rather a shining jewel in one's infernal crown. 

So they return to Gehenna. if only briefly. The moment they feel the tears begin to freeze on their cheeks, they flee back to the world of men having realized that though they'll weep as both a human and devil, at least as one of the former there'll be moments when the tears they shed dry.

I've never understood how the ugly, the repulsive, the lost, unloved and left behind consider stories of aging women taking their lives because they haven't found love to be a victory.

These are attractive women, women that something like myself would consider himself blessed to have the tiniest chance of having a relationship with. Yes, they're a little bit older. There are the beginnings of wrinkles creasing the corners of their eyes and lips. Their breasts and bellies are begging to sag. What of it? We're all of us aging, all of us growing older together, dying in lockstep. The horror of marching toward infirmity, senility and, eventually, oblivion has the possibility of being rendered beautiful by taking that journey with someone beside you, her arm around your waist and her's around your's. 

Yet these women consider you an unworthy partner; having recognized night is falling they would rather watch their final sunset alone than do so clasping hands with a monster. As terrifying as Death is, he's proven to be a more desirable suitor than you could ever hope to be. Hold your arms open waiting to receive these women, just as desperate to be loved as you are and, with less than a moment of hesitation, they'll rush to Sammael's fleshless embrace.

Not even the pettiest schadenfraude can be gleaned from the realization that, given the choice between sharing a bed with you and rotting in a grave alone, a woman has chosen the latter.

>tfw ugly bot not ugly enough so people feel sorry for you
>WHY CAN'T I JUST BE A FREAK

There's a reason why charity is considered a virtue and pity a vice, and it's the same reason the former is accepted with gratitude and the latter resentfully rejected. Proper charity is one man giving to a fellow human being due to a sense of brotherhood and its an act that accomplishes some actual good. Feed another person and he ceases to be tormented by hunger pangs, offer feasible advice and you've helped him extricate from his problems. 

The difference is that pity doesn't do a whit of good for its recipients precisely because it's an empty gift offered purely for the sake of the one giving it. Men speaking kind words when it comes to the plight of monsters with whom they share no sense of kinship are doing nothing more than chanting mantras against the forces of Fate and circumstance that can damn or save, bless or curse, through the compulsion of their gentlest whim. The handsome man forces a single tear from otherwise dry eyes for the sake of the repulsive monster because it's the closest thing to humility he's capable of. We suspect, whether rightly or wrongly, that powers that govern the cosmos despise hubris; and even gods know better than to tempt the Fates. 

The superficial kindness of the lovely toward the repulsive that they hate no less than the rest of humanity is the remnant of a very old superstition, no different than the villages who would provide petty sacrifices to the goblins and other evil sprites that lurked in the periphery, the shadowy places just beyond the reach of the village's light. If you don't want to suffer disease, you give the devil of pestilence his due regardless of how fiercely you despise him. 

The pity the lovely have for the repulsive is a ward, a charm. Soothe the monster, placate it, and it'll remain in the dark, distant places where it belongs.

>I just came to the realization that I am God. This planet, the universe and all of you are only my imagination.

The last time I heard someone assert something like this was when I was a student.

The person who uttered it was a student of the fine arts. College is often depicted as a strange liminal space between adolescence and adulthood where the typical rules of right and wrong are suspended. People can at long last drink what they wish, fuck who ever they will, indulge in every vice without the fear of judgement: small sins indulged in by imps dipping their toes in the River Styx. 

But my friend had already been fucked by countless men before stepping into the halls of Academia. Sexual promiscuity passe for her, she found a far more exciting dream.

Her professors taught that God died long ago and that artists would be tasked with filling the void. The world had grown ugly and sick; it was the glorious purpose of the artists to redeem it by rendering it lovely and healthy again. 

So my friend began to consider her paintings. the majority of which depicted herself, the Newest Testament. Her nightmares became ordeals with devils and her dreams trysts with angels.

During one of our last conversations she declared that I, as well as every other person she knew, was nothing more than a figment of her imagination. I'll admit, I found the idea seductive. The Great Goddess herself sat before me, within my reach. She was a bit overweight, her eyesight somewhat dim. The Architect of the Universe who decided, in Her infinite wisdom, that I should go to the grave unloved and unwanted, could have had the song of creation issuing from her throat choked into silence had I been so inclined.

Men make very poor gods and women even worse goddesses. It's the blessing of every counterfeit deity that each authentic devil recognizes this pitiful truth and relinquishes his hammer, too sad and tired to smash an idol even emptier than himself.

>even if youre deformed to the point where you cant get a gf, and if that matters so much to you, work so hard that youll be able to afford surgery and be in a position of power so that you dont even need one. and if you dont even do that, focus on other things. women are a meme. never has a chick made my life any better

Repulsive wizard though I am, one of those things who would live, grow old and die in the nursery regardless of whether he dreamed his nightmares in a rotting crib surrounded by unwanted moldy toys or in a sprawling palace adorned by coveted golden ones, even I recognize a sexual relationship is no panacea. 

A man with a diseased mind, cursed with a soul rendered morbid by infirmity, could be granted entrance into Heaven and suffer just as acutely as a healthy man condemned to Hell. Mother Nature can be exceptionally cruel to Her children, and sometimes She'll visit deformity upon the Spirit rather than the Flesh.

Angels can grow ill; incapable of experiencing the beauty that should have been their birthright as beautiful things, they stray from the delights of the Garden and become ensnared by its thorns. They smell flowers and the stench of sulfur fills their nostrils; permitted to consume the sweetest fruit, they taste nothing but ash.

That particular tragedy doesn't negate that of the the monster with a healthy spirit who would be capable of enjoying the Garden but isn't permitted entrance into it. He could enjoy a flower's scent but his nostrils are only allowed the smell of rot. The apple's sweetness is something his palate is capable of appreciating, but the fruit would rot before it would condescend to be touched by the monster's repulsive tongue.

Handsome Devil with his leprous soul and Repulsive Demon with its twisted body envy, resent and hate each other with the same frothing pathos.

Absurd, isn't it, considering that God and Nature have sentenced them to burn beside each other in Hell?

>Hope you get better though, maybe you will find a lot of happiness in solitude like the Great Desert Fathers have.

Have? Or perhaps more appropriately "had". The Desert Fathers are, and are now, and will always be gone. They were a failed experiment at one time and, that trial having run its monstrously unsuccessful course, neither exist now nor will they ever exist again.

It would be a grand testament to the power of the human spirit if it could actually exist in isolation. It would be marvelous if the spirit of a man, exorcised from his flesh, could during its long exile in the wilderness become something akin to a god. Hungry, he could devour his own flesh and somehow be satisfied, learning how to become a sacrifice upon his own altar. Desperate for a cooling rain, he could weep and wash the heat of the wicked world away. Seized by the Spirit, Jesus was driven into the desert so that he could, by enduring its agonies, learn how to become a god.

That's the myth, the fantasy, the illusory solace Nature offers to those who are relegated to the wasteland. Sadly, fairy-tales have the tendency of falling short. Christ, driven down into harsh wastelands by his divine madness, was tempted Lord Lucifer and, enduring his harsh initiation, earned the right to be considered the Son of God. And when his time of trial was complete, angels came to minster to him.

Saint Anthony wasn't provided that kind of solace. Suffering in his isolation, he prayed to God and God sent demons to torment him. He endured the tortures allotted to him and his reward was the opportunity to utter prayers so incoherent that the petitioner had no idea whether he was addressing the Queen of Heaven or the King of Hell. After a point, wild with desperation, it no longer mattered to our exile which one of the two answers.

Eventually, the Desert Philosopher expects only silence because, regardless of how loudly he cries out, neither God nor Goddess will respond with anything else.

>So anon, your still a virgin? At 30?
>>43307699
>As a Wizard, I have an advice for my brethren: if anyone ask you this question, lie

The last thing I want is to sow discord by disagreeing with one of my brothers. Having said that, I'm afraid I'll do so just the same.

If one reaches the age of thirty and has never had a single woman desire him, his fate has been sealed. The contract's been signed, with God enthusiastically providing the pen and Nature the ink. 

If someone who belongs to the tribe of men asks a thing sworn to the race of monsters whether they're a virgin, they already know the answer. It's a question posed for the same reason humans visit a carnival and pound the panes of glass separating them from the abominations on the other side. They want to see another tear, to hear another moan. The agony of those in Hell is precious if for no other reason than it can transform the misery of men into the joy of angels. 

Thing of it is, they come expecting this elixir in an adulterated form. By eliciting an old virgin's obvious lies, they've extracted diluted tears they can swallow without singing their throats in much the same way the Protestants can only participate in the Eucharist after they've convinced themselves they're drinking grape juice and not the blood of a tortured god.

Wizards, if an actual person is bold enough to ask whether you're a virgin, tell them. You're a sacrificial animal regardless, so why lay down as a smiling lamb instead of a screaming goat? Make them earn the joy they take in your misery. Tilt their world just a bit, remind them there are those who go down to the grave completely unwanted and unloved, that your biography is more than a sad fairy-tale or the fodder for cheap comedies. 

Though small, the race of monster will always be and men will always drink themselves silly with our blood. 

At the very least, we can take pains to ensure it burns just a little bit as it trickles down their throats.
>>43292516
>Why do ugly incels claim 80% of women pursue only the top 20% of men? It's like their incel religion, even though most people know it's not true at all.

Well, perhaps closer to a myth than a religion.

The thing about most myths is that though composed of smoke and illusion, nearly all have some tiny spark of truth glowing at their heart.

It's without a doubt that there will always be some men no woman will ever want. Regardless of how magnetic their personalities, how self-assured, how dedicated to improving themselves they may be, their ugliness will preclude any woman from ever desiring them. 

These true casualties of Nature's war are far and few between. Yet there are a far greater number of reasonably attractive men who find themselves without a mate. Many are socially awkward, shy, desperate to reach out but lacking the courage to. Too fragile to risk a first rejection or too demoralized to endure a second, they invoke their sacred story. The struggles of the Garden too daunting, they assure themselves they are just as repulsive as the true abominations are and retreat to safety of dim Purgatory.

It goes without saying the legion of lost souls haunting Limbo are not the same as the tiny number of proper monsters born to Hell. Deluded by their myth, the former eventually forget that simple fact and commit the same error a gentile does whenever he mistakes a dybbuk for a devil.
>>43274826
>eventually you internalize it/embrace it to the point of which you both dont care and would still feel like a virgin even if you fucked.

As a repulsive old wizard, that point is academic for something like myself, a mere thought experiment. Which isn't to say it's not a compelling one.

The wizard comes of age in Hell, with the demons serving as his familiars both his most hated tormentors and most intimate companions. Frothing Wrath, the shameful Lust of something that feels desire that will never be reciprocated, the grinding Envy that grips one's heart with its slimy claw every time one witnesses the happiness of others you'll never participate in: these become as natural as the flow of one's breath or the rush of one's blood. They alone know your secrets, are the only witnesses to your tears on those rare occasions when you weep alone in the dead of night.

Admittedly, it would be horrifying to face the prospect of having those demons driven out; unclean though they are, this legion of wicked spirits is the closest thing to a soul the unlovable monster ever had. Tantalizing though it's light may be, crawling into Paradise would be terrifying for a thing that spent a lifetime learning how to see in Pandemonium's darkness.

It would be a frightening and dangerous journey, just as all true adventures are. Granted, it's one that will never be anything more than fantasy for the unlovable, something for them to dream about while they sleep alone. And if their visions progress into nightmares, well, they'll inevitably awake with tears drying their faces.

Denied initiation into the race of men, one of the few mysteries permitted to the abominations given to such dreams is whether the tears staining their cheeks after waking are those of joy or despair.

>No matter what achievements I earn, I am still an unhappy miserable person.

While attending college, one of my Religious Studies professors screened Peter Brooks' "Mahabharata" in his Indian Philosophy seminar. It's been more than a decade and a half since then and I remember very little of it. However, one moment in the picture remains perfectly distinct in my mind. The villain of the epic, Duryodhana, had every thing any mortal man could ever desire. He had a harem of the loveliest women willing to satisfy his every sexual whim. Each dinner he attended was a feast, every battle resulted in victory. 

For all of his apparent blessings, Duryodhana was miserable. Seeing him drowning in melancholy, on the verge of succumbing to despair, his advisers reminded him of all of the good things he should be enjoying but, for whatever reason, was incapable of finding happiness in. All of their attempts to cheer him failing, they begged their lord to tell them why he was so discontent hoping, perhaps, they could bring him joy.

Wild, in a fit of frothing rage, the king cried out: "Why am I discontented? Because I want to be discontented!"

According to the Mahabharata, Duryodhana was a son of Kali, that wicked goddess who ruled the relentless flow of time. In that respect, we're all of us brothers to the miserable king. Our mortality demands we never find permanent joy lest we grow stagnant, lest we surrender to Death while we still draw breath. 

Haunting the forums dedicated to the incels, you'll find young men lamenting their virginity. When they eventually have sex as the vast majority of men do, they mourn the fact they never had a romantic relationship during adolescence.

The moment Faust became satisfied with Life was same he lost his humanity and surrendered his soul to Hell.
>>43187857
>to the ugly/undesirable robots 
>do you think plastic surgery can fix your ugliness/unattractiveness?

I've never been comfortable with the notion of plastic surgery. Granted, it should be something any ugly man would consider a boon. If God and Nature have been stingy with their blessings, why not appeal to the alchemy of men as a recourse? When he sold his soul to Mephistopheles for the chance to experience what he never had during his long, lonely life, the good Doctor Faust was taken by his new familiar to a witch whose potions had the power to make the sorcerer young and beautiful. What does it matter if one's loveliness is artificial if it permits him to experience joys that would otherwise be impossible? 

On the face of it, there's an appeal to the fantasy of tricking your way into a Paradise that you were never intended for. Why languish in Hell when you can slip into Heaven unnoticed? 

The problem is that, when all is said and done, all of that beauty is just glamour: a hollow illusion wrought with scalpels and stitches. The monster's ugliness stains his blood; essential to his very being, it's the closest thing an abomination has to a soul. That a ghoul resents being born in Hell doesn't change the fact that it's Hell he swore an oath to the moment he drew his very first breath. Though a love-spell can permeate no deeper than the skin, true ugliness reaches to the very heart of one's being.

As a monster, I dream of what it would be like to live as men do: to be loved, to be desired, to be considered with admiration. But I'd rather mourn for the impossibility of love as a proper citizen of Pandemonium than pretend I've achieved it as a hunted fugitive in Paradise. 

The monster who refuses to wrench the horns from his skull in a futile attempt to resemble a man retains a tiny bit of dignity in the process. Attempt to do otherwise, and he sacrifices what little virtue he actually possesses for the hope of something he never will.
>>43102905
>Or does some hope still linger inside?

We all know the story of Pandora's Jar. Overwhelmed by curiosity, the most dangerous vice, the first woman broke her jar's seal to peak beneath its lid. The act, though performed without malice, unloosed evil upon the world. Sickness, strife, violence and death leaped forth and began their endless campaign to extinguish mankind. Hope, however, remained within the jar.

More optimistic reiterations of the myth consider the remaining Hope to be the element that allowed mankind to sustain itself in the face of the horrors Pandora unleashed. Though no antidote, the remaining tonic served the purpose of every anesthetic: to endure the pain that is every man's lot long enough for him to justify drawing his next breath. 

The problem with such interpretations is that, unlike the devils that escaped from the jar, Hope remained in beautiful Pandora's possession and under Her control. Though misery was inevitable for every man, respite from it certainly wasn't. The Eternal Feminine had the authority to provide a glimpse of its light or deny it as She saw fit, guarding it as fiercely as anyone would the closest thing to kindness the heartless gods had allotted to the race of men.

One only experiences Hope if lovely Pandora grants him license to. If one can imagine being loved, he is lovable. Dreams are the blessings bestowed upon men who have drawn close enough to Pandora to be bathed in the light of the Hope she guards so steadfastly. Those unworthy to step into Her presence, the things abandoned to Despair by God and Nature, have only nightmares awaiting them when they close their eyes and descend into sleep: that daily rehearsal for death that prepares men for Paradise and monsters for Hell.

Never disregard the blessing of Hope simply due to its fragility. Though there is the ever-present threat of it shattering in your trembling hands, there are those who will never look upon it, let alone touch it.

It's absurd that a god like Dionysus was considered the divine embodiment of frenzy or Moloch that of wild, ravenous hunger when Chronos exceeded them both. 

Spending our entire lives immersed in Time's relentless flow, we have the tendency to become numb to his exceptional coldness. His cruelties are subtle and we become strangely accustomed to the death he inflicts only because his instruments of torture bleed us out so gradually.

Yet, suddenly, we find ourselves anemic and sick, gasping and struggling for that next breath. Life is very nearly at its end and we find ourselves horrified by the abruptness of that realization. After all, weren't we just a moment ago healthy and strong? Wasn't the ugly hag, despised and discarded, the object of desire a mere decade ago? Wasn't the broken old man, his bones aching and his organs failing, no more possibilities before him and a lifetime of regrets behind him, a healthy young man borne aloft by ambition a mere two decades prior? 

The pretty whores who performed in their pornographic shows age just as quickly as the healthy men who once masturbated to them. We all of us march forward to the grave together, driven forward by Chronos' scourge. What does it matter that some of us are closer to Death than others? We're all swallowed up by him regardless.

Whatever tortures Gehenna's flames can offer, they pale in comparison to those inflicted by the sands of Time. While the Devil takes only the hindmost, Chronos claims us all, righteous and wicked, lovely and hideous, and delights in doing so slowly.

>Being devoid of that entire aspect has never particularly bothered me, but there's a tripfag named WitchKing who's the same age as myself, he's despair incarnate, so I guess it fires differently.

I'll admit that if the testimony of my fellow wizards is to be believed, I've had a far more difficult time entering our sad little lodge than most. When I was younger and knew even then that dying a virgin would be an inevitability, I took some solace in the assurances that my libido would wane as I approached forty but, at least insofar as my own case is concerned, I'm afraid I was lied to. There's been no peace, no cooling of the passions, a gentle descent toward midnight. My twilight years are nearly over and I'm still absurdly clinging to what little light is left glowing on the horizon. We all go down to the dark but it would have been nice to have walked beneath the sun just once instead of having to pine for it while looking up from the black, subterranean places reserved for the hideous. 

I fall asleep at night and still have the silly dreams of adolescents on the verge of entering adulthood. During my laughable little sojourns down in Dreamland, I'm not revisiting old sexual conquests but instead embracing women with all the clumsiness of someone more than two decades my junior. An authentic smile from a woman, an awkward kiss: these are the substance of a wizard's dreams. And then he wakes and, glimpsing himself in the mirror, realizes his flesh has grown old while his spirit remains that of a child. Peter Pan has lost all of his pleasant thoughts, his magic has become corrupted, he can no longer fly and the tide is creeping in.

Hopefully Pan was correct when he claimed dying would be a great adventure. For a wizard unable to come to terms with his circumstance, or a monster unable to raise his head up from the ground due to the weight of the horns sprouting from his brow, death is the only adventure left remaining to him.

>What i really want to do is save people from the demons that plague them. Modern society is demonic. Should I become an exorcist? How do I exorcise people?

The desire to relieve people from the devils that haunt them is certainly an admirable sentiment. A demon is an unclean spirit, after all, something that pollutes the soul, and to be relieved of such a burden would be a wondrous thing. It's no coincidence that the foundation of Christ's popularity was his purported ability as an exorcist. The moment a heretic can deliver a man from his devils is the same moment he escapes the stake and takes his place among the saints.

Yet even Christ acknowledged the fundamental problem of exorcism: drive out a devil, and seven worse rush in replace it. Our demons are essential to us; it would be easier to drive the marrow from our bones or the blood from our veins than it would be to exile the devils from our psyche. The tutelary spirits appointed to us at birth aren't Raphael, Gabriel or Michael but rather Asmodeus, Sammael and Lucifer. 

The Spirit that seized Jesus after his baptism wasn't an angel but a monster, a carrion bird pretending to be a dove, a vicious, mad thing that drove him into the wilderness to starve. Beyond the reach of both God and Man, the offspring of both struggled with his own devil and, in the process, reconciled his impossible heritage. The priest that sanctified the marriage of Heaven and Earth was Hell.

Don't aspire to drive out a man's devils. They inflict unspeakable pain, but it's only through their black alchemy that the fragile humans they torment are offered the tiniest hope of participating in the divine.

>can ugly people ever truly be happy?

I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine regarding the plight of the truly ugly, that tiny minority of people who no one could ever possibly desire. Said friend is a devout Catholic who believes in the concept of vocation: insofar as every person is concerned, we each of us has a role in God's design. Of course, submitting to it fully is a prerequisite for happiness; one of the terrifying things about free will is the fact that it allows one license to walk down into Hell with his eyes wide open.

To the Catholics, both the religious life of the cenobite and life of the layman raising a family are valid vocations. I asked what to make of those men who want marriage, children and all the rest but are too repulsive for any woman to want marriage or children with them. He suggested the monastic life but, sadly, not every man is suited to the religious life simply because he's ugly. He desires to have children, he desires to live as most men live. In such cases, the Flesh and Spirit of the ugly find themselves in vicious conflict as long as the former draws breath in service of the latter. When a man meant for family is incapable of it by virtue of his soul, he joins the brotherhood of philanderers. When a man whose spirit is meant for family is not allowed to have one by virtue of his hideous flesh, he is baptized into the order of monsters. 

My friend had no answer to the dilemma faced by the ugly who aren't content to live as the unlovable should be. A good man, he could only offer that his heart broke for them. Which he meant in all sincerity; he cares for something as disgusting as myself, after all.

Father God and Mother Natural are both beautiful, but even lovely parents can give rise to abominations. So God, in His wisdom, gave birth to Death, the only exorcist powerful enough to drive a spirit from a body unsuited to it and, in lieu of happiness, at the very least can grant peace.

Seeing a happy man with a wife by his side condemning other men because they haven't attained what he has, the world takes upon a surreal quality. This fellow has closed his eyes for the sake of some dreamworld and, having done so, feels himself justified indicting those mourning the fact that they live in a nightmare.

The vast majority want precisely what this fellow flaunts: a loving wife, a happy family, a part, however small, in Nature's simple passion play. 

Yet seeking admittance, more and more men are being turned away; deemed unfit to take their place upon the stage, they find themselves relegated to the darkness reserved for an audience who's only option is to watch in silence. 

There was a time when the unloved were the tiniest of minorities. The abominations that had no proper role in the natural course of things were so unique that the only place one could find them was on display in some sideshow while alive and burning in Gehenna's filthy ghettos after death.

Strangely, something has changed. Perfectly normal men have undergone a baptism and have emerged from the waters as repulsive monsters. The sideshow tent no longer remains standing because a multitude has flooded into it and it's burst at the seams. 

There was a time when men lined up and paid a quarter for the privilege of glimpsing an abomination because freaks were so very rare; inheritors of Paradise, they were morbidly curious about what it would be like to burn in Hell. But Hell is now above and Heaven so very far below, and a parade of monsters line up of for the sake of seeing a human being on display, dreaming of what it would be like to spend a moment treading upon the Earth.

The gates of Hell have been flung open and a host of refugees are flooding in. As one of Perdition's natives, there's something distasteful about having to share one's ghetto with normal men. Lamentably, though we'd like to send them back, they no longer have a home to return to.

As a wizard, I'll confess I found that video disturbing. One can't help but feel vicarious hurt on the part of the silly middle-aged virgin being lampooned by what appears to be a happy couple. There's something grotesque about the healthy taking pleasure in the misery of the sick, of the living making sport of the dead.

Having said that, distasteful though such a display may seem, it's entirely understandable. 
The Living harbor a visceral antipathy toward the Dead, Beauty and all of its goodness can't help but despise Ugliness. There's no man nor woman alive who, upon seeing a monster, doesn't pray for its funeral. 

Yet we live in gentle times, don't we? Mankind has been robbed of its authority to strangle abominations while they still slumber in their cradles. A more sophisticated morality demands we permit Mother Nature's abortions to grow to full term, allow disease to blossom, give license to the things that should have been relegated to the world of nightmares to intrude into the waking world.

Placed into the unpleasant position of abiding monsters, mankind has learned how to render them innocuous. By clapping them in chains and imprisoning them in sideshows, otherwise terrifying devils are reduced to amusing freaks. Smear a hideous visage with the face paint of a clown and adorn its twisted frame in colorful rags, and the deformed dwarf that once inspired nothing but nausea now elicits laughter. 

And in this way the Jester finds himself in the presence of kings. He'll dance and make a fool of himself for the sake of being tolerated long enough to dream his next dream. Asleep, he'll remember his proper place as one of Chaos' sons. He'll remember the horns that adorned his head before the beautiful race of men wrenched them from his skull so that a silly cap with tinkling bells could be drawn over his brow.

Never forget that every laugh inspired by a dancing clown is a nervous one.

As a wizard, I'll confess I found that video disturbing. One can't help but feel vicarious hurt on the part of the silly middle-aged virgin being lampooned by what appears to be a happy couple. There's something grotesque about the healthy taking pleasure in the misery of the sick, of the living making sport of the dead.

Having said that, distasteful though such a display may seem, it's entirely understandable. 
The Living harbor a visceral antipathy toward the Dead, Beauty and all of its goodness can't help but despise Ugliness. There's no man nor woman alive who, upon seeing a monster, doesn't pray for its funeral. 

Yet we live in gentle times, don't we? Mankind has been robbed of its authority to strangle abominations while they still slumber in their cradles. A more sophisticated morality demands we permit Mother Nature's abortions to grow to full term, allow disease to blossom, give license to the things that should have been relegated to the world of nightmares to intrude into the waking world.

Placed into the unpleasant position of abiding monsters, mankind has learned how to render them innocuous. By clapping them in chains and imprisoning them in sideshows, otherwise terrifying devils are reduced to amusing freaks. Smear a hideous visage with the face paint of a clown and adorn its twisted frame in colorful rags, and the deformed dwarf that once inspired nothing but nausea now elicits laughter.

>Is this fucking thread from /x/?

We forget that, as infants, we enter this world in nearly complete darkness. Granted, light shone upon us and dragged us up out of oblivion. Yet, in those earliest moments, said light is very dim. It does little more than illumine enough of the world to show us that the vast majority belongs to the nighttime. The newborn wakes and, when presented with the endless potential offered by unfathomable darkness, is far more likely to imagine devils than he is angels. Monsters slither beneath the bed, boogeymen claw at the closet door. Upon being initiated into an ostensibly rational cosmos, the toddler's first suspicion is that, beneath all of its orderly trappings, Chaos reigns.

Time passes and the sun climbs higher. Shadows recede and monsters retreat. We commune with our fellow men and, finding nothing terrifying in them, are tricked into believing we've left our old fears in nursery to rot with the dusty fairy-stories about the things that lurk on the Nightside of the world. 

Sadly, the devils that leered at us as we slept fitfully in our cradle follow us. We'll catch a glimpse of them from the corner of our eye, if only for a moment. Hearing the story of some vicious murder or unthinkable depravity, we'll be reminded of the terrifying lullabyes that sang us to sleep during those first few years when the world was haunted and every dream was still a nightmare.

Years pass and the shadows lengthen. Death returns with all of his majesty and the geriatric becomes the vulnerable infant once again. Finally the victim himself, the old man remembers the demons of disorder that had pursued him his entire life but that he believed himself immune from because they had, for whatever reason, decided to take someone else. 

The devil claims the hindmost. That reassuring thought serves as every man's talisman until that inevitable moment when he looks over his shoulder and realizes there's no one left behind him.

>how do you get rid of the demon Asmodeus and stop him from haunting your dreams

I suppose you could always try to immolate the viscera of a fish; according to the Book of Tobit the smoke that resulted from doing so was sufficient to drive the demon away. Apparently Lord Asmodeus found the smell particularly offensive. Sort of humorous, isn't it? Such a seemingly insignificant thing was able to drive away a prince of devils.

Ridiculous, to be sure, but there's truth at the heart of even the most absurd joke. It's strange that Asmodeus is now considered the god of sexual excess, the tutelary spirit of prostitutes and patron saint of whoremongers, especially considering he was considered the villain of the Book of Tobit not because he encouraged sex but because he prevented it. According to the story, every time the heroine Sarah married, Asmodeus murdered her groom before the union could be consummated. The demon was not so much a god of sexual license as he was one of sexual frustration. By preventing the natural course of things, defying both the Creator and His design, our devil corrupted sexual desire by turning it into unsatisfied lust. 

Asmodeus haunts every man unable to experience and express sexuality according to Nature's dictates. Through his black alchemy he turns healthy impulses into sterile perversions. Whispering into the ears of the repulsive things who have no hope of participating in the beautiful, he twists the inherent adoration of what is lovely into the resentment of it. It's to this devil that every wizard is sworn to the moment he first draws breath.

However, assuming you're a man and not some abomination, it's entirely possible to slip the vicious imp. The sacrament that will deliver you will not be that of exorcism but that of marriage.

Provided, of course, that unlike one of the princes of Hell, you can endure the occasional smell of fish.

>I have no clue why people still try to cling to the incel communities once they have "ascended". Its a lonely, terrible place.

True, those communities are terrible places. However, horror you find in such places is almost magical. Having crossed the circled line into them, one finds the Natural order inverted. Whereas those who belong to the world of men vie to crown themselves the most brilliant or the most beautiful, within the sad ghettos reserved for monsters the citizens fight tooth and nail for the privilege of being considered the most repulsive. Strange, perhaps, but there's certainly a degree of logic to it. When one finds himself down in Hell, the lower one descends the closer he comes to taking his place upon its throne. If one is going to be just as unloved as an imp as he would be a satan, if one has no hope of even the simplest joy, at the very least he an aspire to be majestic in his misery. The Lord of Hell will always be less than the least significant of men but, at the very least, he can outrank the pettiest of devils.

Well, most of these "imps" slip Hell as Nature takes its course. The day comes when they smile at a woman and their gesture is reciprocated. They begin to live as nearly every person does. Stripped of their stubby horns and tiny fangs, Pandemonium casts them out into the world of men.

Our former devils expected Paradise only to find a rough world waiting for them, one of infidelity, broken hearts and tears. I have no doubt they have moments when they pine for the world they came from and all of its pristine darkness, where a tear was not a shameful thing but rather a shining jewel in one's infernal crown. 

So they return to Gehenna. if only briefly. The moment they feel the tears begin to freeze on their cheeks, they flee back to the world of men having realized that though they'll weep as both a human and devil, at least as one of the former there'll be moments when the tears they shed dry.

I've never understood how the ugly, the repulsive, the lost, unloved and left behind consider stories of aging women taking their lives because they haven't found love to be a victory.

These are attractive women, women that something like myself would consider himself blessed to have the tiniest chance of having a relationship with. Yes, they're a little bit older. There are the beginnings of wrinkles creasing the corners of their eyes and lips. Their breasts and bellies are begging to sag. What of it? We're all of us aging, all of us growing older together, dying in lockstep. The horror of marching toward infirmity, senility and, eventually, oblivion has the possibility of being rendered beautiful by taking that journey with someone beside you, her arm around your waist and her's around your's. 

Yet these women consider you an unworthy partner; having recognized night is falling they would rather watch their final sunset alone than do so clasping hands with a monster. As terrifying as Death is, he's proven to be a more desirable suitor than you could ever hope to be. Hold your arms open waiting to receive these women, just as desperate to be loved as you are and, with less than a moment of hesitation, they'll rush to Sammael's fleshless embrace.

Not even the pettiest schadenfraude can be gleaned from the realization that, given the choice between sharing a bed with you and rotting in a grave alone, a woman has chosen the latter.
